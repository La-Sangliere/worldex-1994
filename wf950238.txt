                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy's base is agriculture, which employs about 70% of the
     labor force and contributes 40% to GDP. Coconuts, bananas, and vanilla
     beans are the main crops and make up two-thirds of exports. The
     country must import a high proportion of its food, mainly from New
     Zealand. The manufacturing sector accounts for only 11% of GDP.
     Tourism is the primary source of hard currency earnings, but the
     island remains dependent on sizable external aid and remittances to
     offset its trade deficit. The economy continued to grow in 1993
     largely because of a rise in squash exports, increased aid flows, and
     several large construction projects. The government is now turning its
     attention to further development of the private sector and the
     reduction of the budget deficit.
