                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils,
     regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt.
     The economy has been devastated by widespread political instability,
     mismanagement, and civil war since independence in 1962. (GDP remains
     below the levels of the early 1970s, as does industrial production.)
     Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, employing
     over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export crop and
     accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government
     has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking
     currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing
     prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The
     policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation, which was
     running at over 300% in 1987, and boosting production and export
     earnings. In 1990-93, the economy has turned in a solid performance
     based on continued investment in the rehabilitation of infrastructure,
     improved incentives for production and exports, and gradually
     improving domestic security.
