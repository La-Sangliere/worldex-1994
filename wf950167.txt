                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     One of Africa's poorest countries, Mozambique has failed to exploit
     the economic potential of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and
     transportation resources. Indeed, national output, consumption, and
     investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of
     internal disorders, lack of government administrative control, and a
     growing foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an
     economic reform policy, resulted in successive years of economic
     growth in the late 1980s, but aid has declined steadily since 1989.
     Agricultural output is at only 75% of its 1981 level, and grain has to
     be imported. Industry operates at only 20-40% of capacity. The economy
     depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat. Peace accords
     signed in October 1992 improved chances of foreign investment, aided
     IMF-supported economic reforms, and supported continued economic
     recovery.
