                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The Malaysian economy, a mixture of private enterprise and a soundly
     managed public sector, has posted a remarkable record of 8%-9% average
     growth in 1987-93. This growth has resulted in a substantial reduction
     in poverty and a marked rise in real wages. Despite sluggish growth in
     the major world economies in 1992-93, demand for Malaysian goods
     remained strong, and foreign investors continued to commit large sums
     in the economy. The government is aware of the inflationary potential
     of this rapid development and is closely monitoring fiscal and
     monetary policies.
