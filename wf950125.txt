                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     The economy is based largely on financial services, agriculture, and
     tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are
     important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of
     dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export
     earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EU countries. In 1986 the
     finance sector overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP,
     accounting for 40% of the island's output. In recent years the
     government has encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the
     result that an electronics industry has developed alongside the
     traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material and energy
     requirements are imported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food
     needs.
