Overview:
     With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, prospects
     seemed bright for a fairly rapid incorporation of East Germany into
     the highly successful West German economy. The Federal Republic,
     however, continues to experience difficulties in integrating and
     modernizing eastern Germany, and the tremendous costs of unification
     pushed western Germany into its deepest recession since World War II.
     The western German economy shrank by 1.9% in 1993 as the Bundesbank
     maintained high interest rates to offset the inflationary effects of
     large government deficits and high wage settlements. Eastern Germany
     grew by 7.1% in 1993 but this was from a shrunken base. Despite
     government transfers to the east amounting to nearly $110 billion
     annually, a self-sustaining economy in the region is still some years
     away. The bright spots are eastern Germany's construction,
     transportation, telecommunications, and service sectors, which have
     experienced strong growth. Western Germany has an advanced market
     economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly urbanized
     and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards,
     abundant leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits.
     Western Germany is relatively poor in natural resources, coal being
     the most important mineral. Western Germany's world-class companies
     manufacture technologically advanced goods. The region's economy is
     mature: services and manufacturing account for the dominant share of
     economic activity, and raw materials and semimanufactured goods
     constitute a large portion of imports. In recent years, manufacturing
     has accounted for about 31% of GDP, with other sectors contributing
     lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1993 accounted for about
     20.5% of GDP. GDP in the western region is now $19,400 per capita, or
     78% of US per capita GDP. Eastern Germany's economy appears to be
     changing from one anchored on manufacturing into a more
     service-oriented economy. The German government, however, is intent on
     maintaining a manufacturing base in the east and is considering a
     policy for subsidizing industrial cores in the region. Eastern
     Germany's share of all-German GDP is only 8% and eastern productivity
     is just 30% that of the west even though eastern wages are at roughly
     70% of western levels. The privatization agency for eastern Germany,
     Treuhand, has privatized more than 90% of the 13,000 firms under its
     control and will likely wind down operations in 1994. Private
     investment in the region continues to be lackluster, resulting
     primarily from the deepening recession in western Germany and
     excessively high eastern wages. Eastern Germany has one of the world's
     largest reserves of low-grade lignite coal but little else in the way
     of mineral resources. The quality of statistics from eastern Germany
     is improving, yet many gaps remain; the federal government began
     producing all-German data for select economic statistics at the start
     of 1992. The most challenging economic problem is promoting eastern
     Germany's economic reconstruction - specifically, finding the right
     mix of fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and tax policies that will spur
     investment in eastern Germany - without destabilizing western
     Germany's economy or damaging relations with West European partners.
     The government hopes a "solidarity pact" among labor unions, business,
     state governments, and the SPD opposition will provide the right mix
     of wage restraints, investment incentives, and spending cuts to
     stimulate eastern recovery. Finally, the homogeneity of the German
     economic culture has been changed by the admission of large numbers of
 
 
     immigrants.
