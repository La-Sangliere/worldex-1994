                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The dissolution of Czechoslovakia into two independent nation states -
     the Czech Republic and Slovakia - on 1 January 1993 has complicated
     the task of moving toward a more open and decentralized economy. The
     old Czechoslovakia, even though highly industrialized by East European
     standards, suffered from an aging capital plant, lagging technology,
     and a deficiency in energy and many raw materials. In January 1991,
     approximately one year after the end of communist control of Eastern
     Europe, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic launched a sweeping
     program to convert its almost entirely state-owned and controlled
     economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these measures resulted in
     privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic activity and
     the setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a cost
     in inflation, unemployment, and lower output. For Czechoslovakia as a
     whole inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992,
     in the Czech lands, inflation dropped to an estimated 12.5% and GDP
     was down a more moderate 5%. In 1993, Czech aggregate output remained
     unchanged, prices rose about 19%, and unemployment hovered above 3%;
     exports to Slovakia fell roughly 30%. An estimated 40% of the economy
     was privately owned. In 1994, Prague expects 2% to 3% growth in GDP,
     roughly 9% inflation, and 5% unemployment. Economic growth in 1994 is
     less important than continued economic restructuring; a mere 1% growth
     would be noteworthy if restructuring is accompanied by rising
     unemployment and enterprise bankruptcies.
