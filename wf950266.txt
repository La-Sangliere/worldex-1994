                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Agriculture employs three-fourths of the labor force and supplies
     almost 40% of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture
     and mining, produces a variety of goods and contributes 35% to GDP.
     Mining accounts for only 5% of both GDP and employment, but supplies
     of minerals and metals account for about 40% of exports. Wide
     fluctuations in agricultural production over the past six years have
     resulted in an uneven growth rate, one that on average has matched the
     3% annual increase in population. Helped by an IMF/World Bank
     structural adjustment program, output rose 3.5% in 1991. A severe
     drought in 1991/92 caused the economy to contract by about 10% in
     1992.
