                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     This modern economy features high-tech agriculture, up-to-date
     small-scale and corporate industry, extensive government welfare
     measures, comfortable living standards, and high dependence on foreign
     trade. Denmark's new center-left coalition government will concentrate
     on reducing the persistent high unemployment rate and the budget
     deficit as well as following the previous government's policies of
     maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. In the face
     of recent international market pressure on the Danish krone, the
     coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency. The coalition
     hopes to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax
     revenues; boost industrial competitiveness through labor market and
     tax reforms and increased research and development funds; and improve
     welfare services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays.
     Prime Minister RASMUSSEN's reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to
     the criteria for European integration by 1999; although Copenhagen has
     won from the European Union (EU) the right to opt out of the European
     Monetary Union (EMU) if a national referendum rejects it. Denmark is,
     in fact, one of the few EU countries likely to fit into the EMU on
     time. Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better than
     many West European countries. As the EU's single market (formally
     established on 1 January 1993) gets underway, Danish economic growth
     is expected to pickup to around 2% in 1994. Danish approval of the
     Maastricht treaty on EU political and economic union in May 1993 has
     reversed the drop in investment, further boosting growth. The current
     account surplus remains strong as limitations on wage increases and
     low inflation - expected to be around 2% in 1994 - improve export
     competitiveness. Although unemployment is high, it remains stable
     compared to most European countries.
