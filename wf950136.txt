                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Kyrgyzstan is one of the smallest and poorest states of the former
     Soviet Union. Its economy is heavily agricultural, producing cotton
     and tobacco on irrigated land in the south, grain in the foothills of
     the north, and sheep and goats on mountain pastures. Its small and
     obsolescent industrial sector, concentrated around Bishkek, is heavily
     dependent on Russia and other CIS countries for customers and for
     inputs, including most of its fuel. Since 1990, the economy has
     contracted by almost 40%. Kyrgyzstan's inflation was high in 1993,
     about 23% per month, but rates were declining at the end of the year.
     Kyrgyzstan introduced its national currency, the som, in May 1993, it
     has privatized 28% of its former state assets, and plans call for a
     massive voucher privatization in 1994. Although Kyrgyzstan will
     receive relatively large flows of foreign aid, ongoing economic
     restructuring will continue to be painful with an anticipated increase
     in unemployment as uneconomic enterprises close. President AKAYEV will
     be under strong political pressure to backtrack on some reform
     measures.
