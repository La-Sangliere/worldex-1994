                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong service and
     manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links
     derived from its entrepot history. The economy registered nearly 10%
     growth in 1993 while stemming inflation. The construction and
     financial services industries and manufacturers of computer-related
     components have led economic growth. Rising labor costs continue to be
     a threat to Singapore's competitiveness, but there are indications
     that productivity is keeping up. In applied technology, per capita
     output, investment, and labor discipline, Singapore has key attributes
     of a developed country.
