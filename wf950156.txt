Overview:
     A majority of the population still depends on agriculture and
     livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many
     subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts
     in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore,
     which account for almost 50% of total exports. The decline in world
     demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in production. The
     nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the
     world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of
     revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in
     1986. In recent years, drought and economic mismanagement have
     resulted in a substantial buildup of foreign debt. The government has
     begun the second stage of an economic reform program in consultation
     with the World Bank, the IMF, and major donor countries.
