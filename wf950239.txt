Overview:
     Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy still enjoys a high per
     capita income by Latin American standards, even though output and
     living standards are substantially below the boom years of 1973-82.
     The country suffers from widespread unemployment, large foreign-debt
     payments, and periods of low international oil prices. Seven
     successive years of economic contraction were followed by small gains
     in output in 1990-91 of 1.2% and 0.9%, in turn followed by small
     declines in 1992-93 of roughly 1.0%. The government has begun to make
     progress in its efforts to diversify exports.
