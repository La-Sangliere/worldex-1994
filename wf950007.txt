     Civil war has been the norm since independence on 11 November 1975; a

     refused to accept its defeat in internationally monitored elections;
     fighting has since resumed throughout much of the countryside.
     Nevertheless, the two sides are negotiating the details for holding
     the second round of presidential elections.

                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 80-90% of the
     population but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil production is
     vital to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. Bitter internal
     fighting continues to severely affect the economy, and food must be
     imported. In 1993, production fell by an estimated 22.6%, mainly
     because of the capture by insurgents of the oil town of Soyo and
     diamond-producing areas in northeastern Angola. Angola has rich
     natural resources - notably gold, diamonds, and arable land, in
     addition to large oil depoaits - but will need to end the war and
     reform government policies if it is to achieve its potential.
