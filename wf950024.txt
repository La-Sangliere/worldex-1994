                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     A per capita income of $8,700 gives Barbados one of the highest
     standards of living of all the small island states of the eastern
     Caribbean. Historically, the economy was based on the cultivation of
     sugar cane and related activities. In recent years, however, the
     economy has diversified into manufacturing and tourism. The tourist
     industry is now a major employer of the labor force and a primary
     source of foreign exchange. The economy slowed in 1990-92 as
     Bridgetown's difficulty in financing its deficits caused it to exert
     control over domestic demands
