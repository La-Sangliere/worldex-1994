                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely
     resembles the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic
     system, and pattern of production. Since World War II the impressive
     growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has
     transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily
     industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada registered one of the
     highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations, averaging about
     3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and
     modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects,
     although the country still faces high unemployment and a growing debt.
     Moreover, the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and
     French-speaking areas has observers discussing a possible split in the
     confederation; foreign investors have become edgy.
