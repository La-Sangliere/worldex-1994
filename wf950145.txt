                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The stable, prosperous economy features moderate growth, low
     inflation, and negligible unemployment. Agriculture is based on small
     but highly productive family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until
     recently dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified,
     particularly toward high-technology firms. During the past decade,
     growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the
     decline in steel. Services, especially banking, account for a growing
     proportion of the economy. Luxembourg participates in an economic
     union with Belgium on trade and most financial matters, is also
     closely connected economically to the Netherlands, and as a member of
     the 12-member European Union enjoys the advantages of the open
     European market.
