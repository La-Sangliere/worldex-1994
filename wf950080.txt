Overview:
     The Faroese, who have long enjoyed the affluent living standards of
     the Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of
     the all-important fishing industry and one of the world's heaviest per
     capita external debts of nearly $30,000. When the nations of the world
     extended their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s,
     the Faroese no longer could continue their traditional long-distance
     fishing and subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas. The
     government's tight controls on fish stocks and its austerity measures
     have caused a recession, and subsidy cuts will force nationalization
     in the fishing industry, which has already been plagued with
     bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to withhold its annual subsidy
     of $130 million - roughly one-third of the islands' budget revenues -
     unless the Faroese make significant efforts to balance their budget.
     To this extent the Faroe government is expected to continue its tough
     policies, including introducing a 20% value-added tax (VAT) in 1993,
     and has agreed to an IMF economic-political stabilization plan. In
     addition to its annual subsidy, the Danish government has bailed out
     the second largest Faroe bank to the tune of $140 million since
     October 1992.
