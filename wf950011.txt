                                 Geography
 
Location:
     body of water mostly north of the Arctic Circle
Map references:
     Arctic Region, Asia, North America, Standard Time Zones of the World
Area:
total area:
     14.056 million sq km
comparative area:
     slightly more than 1.5 times the size of the US; smallest of the
     world's four oceans (after Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian
     Ocean)
note:
     includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East
     Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea,
     Laptev Sea, Northwest Passage, and other tributary water bodies
Coastline:
     45,389 km
International disputes:
     some maritime disputes (see littoral states); Svalbard is the focus of
     a maritime boundary dispute between Norway and Russia
Climate:
     polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow
     annual temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous
     darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers
     characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak
     cyclones with rain or snow
Terrain:
     central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack that
     averages about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges may be
     three times that size; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort Gyral
     Stream, but nearly straight line movement from the New Siberian
     Islands (Russia) to Denmark Strait (between Greenland and Iceland);
     the ice pack is surrounded by open seas during the summer, but more
     than doubles in size during the winter and extends to the encircling
     land masses; the ocean floor is about 50% continental shelf (highest
     percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a central basin
     interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera, Nansen
     Cordillera, and Lomonsov Ridge); maximum depth is 4,665 meters in the
     Fram Basin
Natural resources:
     sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, oil
     and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales)
Environment:
current issues:
     endangered marine species include walruses and whales; fragile
     ecosystem slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions or
     damage
natural hazards:
     ice islands occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island;
     icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme
     northeastern Canada; permafrost in islands; virtually icelocked from
     October to June
 
 
international agreements:
     NA
Note:
     major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to the
     Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait); ships subject to superstructure
     icing from October to May; strategic location between North America
     and Russia; shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and
     western Russia, floating research stations operated by the US and
     Russia; maximum snow cover in March or April about 20 to 50
     centimeters over the frozen ocean and lasts about 10 months

                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Economic activity is limited to the exploitation of natural resources,
     including petroleum, natural gas, fish, and seals.
 
                              Communications
 
Ports:
     Churchill (Canada), Murmansk (Russia), Prudhoe Bay (US)
Telecommunications:
     no submarine cables
Note:
     sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes; the Northwest
     Passage (North America) and Northern Sea Route (Eurasia) are important
     seasonal waterways
