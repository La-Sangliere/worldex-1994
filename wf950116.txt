                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of
     oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale
     private trading and service ventures. Over the past several years, the
     government has introduced several measures to liberalize the economy
     and reduce government intervention, but most of these changes have
     moved slowly because of political opposition. Iran has faced
     increasingly severe financial difficulties in 1992-93 due to an import
     surge since 1989 and general financial mismanagement. At yearend 1993
     the Iranian Government estimated that it owed foreign creditors about
     $30 billion; an estimated $8 billion of this debt was in arrears.
     Earnings from oil exports--which provide over 90% of Iran's export
     revenues--are providing less relief to Iran than usual because of
     declining oil prices. Estimated overall growth was a robust 6.3% in
     1992 and a moderate 3% in 1993.
