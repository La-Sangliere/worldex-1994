Overview:
     GDP expanded by roughly 5.9% in 1993, following growth of 8% in 1992;

     Manuel NORIEGA, even though the government's structural adjustment
     program has been hampered by a lack of popular support and a passive
     administration. Public investment has been limited as the
     administration has kept the fiscal deficit below 2% of GDP.

     government must face in 1994-95.
