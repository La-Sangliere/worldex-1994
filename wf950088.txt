                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural resources and has
     a limited agricultural base. It is one of the world's poorest
     countries with a per capita income of roughly $800. About 75% of the
     population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising, which
     contribute 30% to GDP. Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing
     peanuts, fish, and hides - accounts for less than 10% of GDP. A
     sustained structural adjustment program, including a liberalized trade
     policy, has fostered a respectable 4% rate of growth in recent years.
     Re-export trade constitutes one-third of economic activity; however,
     border closures associated with Senegal's monetary crisis in late 1993
     led to a 50% decline in re-export trade, reducing government revenues
     in turn. Devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has made
     Senegalese goods more competitive, and is likely to prompt a
     relaxation of Senegalese controls, paving the way for a comeback in
     re-exports.
