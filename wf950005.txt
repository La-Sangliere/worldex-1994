                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's economy, accounts for roughly 80%
     of GDP. An estimated 13 million tourists visit annually, attracted by
     Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. The
     banking sector, with its "tax haven" status, also contributes
     substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited by a
     scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The
     principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists
     mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra is a member of
     the EU Customs Union; it is unclear what effect the European Single
     Market will have on the advantages Andorra obtains from its duty-free
     status.
