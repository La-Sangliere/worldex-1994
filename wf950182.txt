                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free market
     activity and government intervention. The government controls key
     areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state
     enterprises) and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and
     areas with sparse resources. Norway also maintains an extensive
     welfare system that helps propel public sector expenditures to
     slightly more than 50% of the GDP and results in one of the highest
     average tax burdens in the world (54%). A small country with a high
     dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an exporter of
     raw materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and
     medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations.
     The country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum,
     hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on
     its oil sector to keep its economy afloat. Although one of the
     government's main priorities is to reduce this dependency, this
     situation is not likely to improve for years to come. The government
     also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and diversify the
     economy through tax reform and a series of expansionary budgets. The
     budget deficit is expected to hit a record 8% of GDP because of
     welfare spending and bail-outs of the banking system. Unemployment
     continues at record levels of over 10% - including those in job
     programs - because of the weakness of the economy outside the oil
     sector. Economic growth was only 1.6% in 1993, while inflation was a
     moderate 2.3%. Oslo, a member of the European Free Trade Area, has
     applied for membership in the European Union and continues to
     deregulate and harmonize with EU regulations. Membership is expected
     in early 1995.
