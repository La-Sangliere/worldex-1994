                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy is tied closely to that of France through subsidies and
     imports. Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and
     forestry are the most important economic activities, with exports of
     fish and fish products (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60% of
     total revenue in 1992. The large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not
     fully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry that provides
     sawn logs for export. Cultivation of crops - rice, cassava, bananas,
     and sugar cane - is limited to the coastal area, where the population
     is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily dependent on imports
     of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem, particularly
     among younger workers.
