                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's highest incomes
     per capita and with a sizable annual trade surplus. Its wealth is
     based on oil and gas output (about 40% of GDP), and the fortunes of
     the economy fluctuate with the prices of those commodities. Since
     1973, the UAE has undergone a profound transformation from an
     impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state
     with a high standard of living. At present levels of production, crude
     oil reserves should last for over 100 years. Although much stronger
     economically than most Gulf states, the UAE faces similar problems
     with weak international oil prices and the pressures for cuts in OPEC
     oil production quotas. The UAE government is encouraging increased
     privatization within the economy.
