Overview:
     Kenya's 3.1% annual population growth rate - one of the highest in the
     world - has led to a decline in per capita output in each of the last
     three years, 1991-93. Undependable weather conditions and a shortage
     of arable land hamper long-term growth in agriculture, the leading
     economic sector. In industry and services, Nairobi's reluctance to
     embrace IMF-supported reforms has held back investment. Ethnic clashes
     and continued suspension of quick disbursing aid by the international
     donors kept growth at only 0.5% in 1993.
