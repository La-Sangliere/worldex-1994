                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     One of the world's poorest and least developed countries, Somalia has
     few resources. Moreover, much of the economy has been devastated by
     the civil war. Agriculture is the most important sector, with
     livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export
     earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for
     their livelihoods make up more than half of the population. Crop
     production generates only 10% of GDP and employs about 20% of the work
     force. The main export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and corn are
     grown for the domestic market. The small industrial sector is based on
     the processing of agricultural products and accounts for less than 10%
     of GDP. Greatly increased political turmoil in 1991-93 has resulted in
     a substantial drop in output, with widespread famine.
