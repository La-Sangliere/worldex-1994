                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Bolstered by a widespread national desire to reintegrate into Western
     Europe, the Estonian government has pursued a program of market
     reforms and rough stabilization measures, which is rapidly
     transforming the economy. Two years after independence - and one year
     after the introduction of the kroon - Estonians are beginning to reap
     tangible benefits; inflation is low; production declines appear to
     have bottomed out; and living standards are rising. Economic
     restructuring is clearly underway with the once-dominant
     energy-intensive heavy industrial sectors giving way to
     labor-intensive light industry and the underdeveloped service sector.
     The private sector is growing rapidly; the share of the state
     enterprises in retail trade has steadily declined and by June 1993
     accounted for only 12.5% of total turnover, and 70,000 new jobs have
     reportedly been created as a result of new business start-ups.
     Estonia's foreign trade has shifted rapidly from East to West with the
     Western industrialized countries now accounting for two-thirds of
     foreign trade.
National product:
     GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $8.8 billion (1993 estimate from
     the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and
     published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993; and as
     extrapolated to 1993 using official Estonian statistics, which are
     very uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)

     exports of meat, fish, dairy products, and potatoes; imports of
     feedgrains for livestock; fruits and vegetables

Telecommunications:
     Estonia's telephone system is antiquated and supports about 400,000
     domestic telephone circuits, i.e. 25 telephones for each 100 persons;
     improvements are being made piecemeal, with emphasis on business needs
     and international connections; there are still about 150,000
     unfulfilled requests for telephone service; broadcast stations - 3 TV
     (provide Estonian programs as well Moscow Ostenkino's first and second
     programs); international traffic is carried to the other former USSR
     republics by land line or microwave and to other countries partly by
     leased connection to the Moscow international gateway switch, and
     partly by a new Tallinn-Helsinki fiber optic submarine cable which
     gives Estonia access to international circuits everywhere; substantial
     investment has been made in cellular systems which are operational
     throughout Estonia and also Latvia and which have access to the
     international packet switched digital network via Helsinki

     exchange rate could produce misleading results
