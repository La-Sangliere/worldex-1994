                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Syria's state-dominated Ba'thist economy has benefited from the Gulf
     war of early 1991, increased oil production, good weather, and
     economic deregulation. Economic growth averaged roughly 10% in
     1990-93. The Gulf war provided Syria an aid windfall of nearly $5
     billion dollars from Arab, European, and Japanese donors. These
     inflows more than offset Damascus's war-related costs and will help
     Syria cover some of its debt arrears, restore suspended credit lines,
     and initiate selected military and civilian purchases. In 1992 the
     government spurred economic development by loosening controls on
     domestic and foreign investment while maintaining strict political
     controls. For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled with a
     large number of poorly performing public sector firms, and industrial
     productivity remains to be improved. Another major long-term concern
     is the additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when its
     vast dam and irrigation projects are completed by mid-decade.
