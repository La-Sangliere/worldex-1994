Overview:
     Because of its offshore oil resources and favorable agricultural
     conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed, most diversified
     primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces
     many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries,
     such as political instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a
     generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. The development
     of the oil sector led rapid economic growth between 1970 and 1985.
     Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986, precipitated by steep declines
     in the prices of major exports: coffee, cocoa, and petroleum. Export
     earnings were cut by almost one-third, and inefficiencies in fiscal
     management were exposed. In 1990-93, with support from the IMF and
     World Bank, the government began to introduce reforms designed to spur
     business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, and
     recapitalize the nation's banks. Political instability following
     suspect elections in 1992 brought IMF/WB structural adjustment to a
     halt. Although the 50% devaluation of the currency in January 1994
     improves the potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and is
     the main barrier to economic improvement.
