     25% of the work force and accounting for over 60% of exports; it is
     also an important source of government revenue. During the 1980s
     tourism became one of the most important and highest growth sectors of
     the economy. In 1988 industry accounted for about 5% of GDP. Real GDP
     is officially estimated to have increased by about 10% annually during
