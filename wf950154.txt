Overview:
     Agriculture and tourism are the mainstays of the economy. Agricultural
     production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important

     cattle ranches supply the domestic meat market. Small-scale industry
     is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist
     industry is the primary source of foreign exchange and employs about
     10% of the labor force. The islands have few natural resources, and
     imports far exceed exports. In 1987 the US Government provided grants
     of $40 million out of the Marshallese budget of $55 million.
