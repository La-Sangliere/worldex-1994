                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Economic performance is closely tied to the fortunes of the oil
     industry, including trends in international oil prices and the ability
     of OPEC producers to agree on output quotas. Petroleum accounts for
     more than 85% of export earnings, about 80% of government revenues,
     and roughly 40% of GDP. Oman has proved oil reserves of 4 billion
     barrels, equivalent to about 20 years' supply at the current rate of
     extraction. Agriculture is carried on at a subsistence level and the
     general population depends on imported food. The government is
     encouraging private investment, both domestic and foreign, as a prime
     force for further economic development.
