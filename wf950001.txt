                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly dependent
     on farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep and goats).
     Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political and
     military upheavals during more than 14 years of war, including the
     nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February
     1989). Over the past decade, one-third of the population fled the
     country, with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million refugees and
     Iran about 3 million. About 1.4 million Afghan refugees remain in
     Pakistan and about 2 million in Iran. Another 1 million probably moved
     into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Although reliable data
     are unavailable, gross domestic product is lower than 12 years ago
     because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade
     and transport.
