                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the basic entrepreneurial
     system overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist system that enlarged the
     public sector from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% in 1989. Since
     then, the public sector has been reduced to about 60% of GDP. Tourism
     continues as a major source of foreign exchange, and agriculture is
     self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and animal
     feedstuffs. Over the last decade, real GDP growth has averaged 1.6% a
     year, compared with the European Union average of 2.2%. Inflation is
     four times the EU average, and the national debt has reached 140% of
     GDP, the highest in the EU. Prime Minister PAPANDREOU will probably
     only make limited progress correcting the economy's problems of high
     inflation, large budget deficit, and decaying infrastructure. His
     economic program suggests that although he will shun his expansionary
     policies of the 1980s, he will avoid tough measures needed to slow
     inflation or reduce the state's role in the economy. He has limited
     the previous government's privatization plans, for example, and has
     called for generous welfare spending and real wage increases. In 1994,
     the GDP growth rate is likely to remain low, and inflation probably
     will accelerate, remaining the highest in the EU. PAPANDREOU'S failure
     to improve the country's economic performance will further strain
     relations with the EU. Since Greece's accession to the then EC in
     1981, Athens' heavy reliance on EU aid - amounting to about 6% of
     Greek GDP annually - and its poor use of Union funds have riled
     Brussels. Its ailing economy will continue to be a drag on European
     economic and monetary union.
