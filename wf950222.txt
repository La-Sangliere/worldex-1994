                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     After the economic boom of 1986-90, the Spanish economy fell into
     recession along with the economies of other EU member states. Real GDP
     barely grew in 1992 and declined by approximately 1% in 1993.
     Unemployment, now nearly one-fourth of the workforce, and the sharp
     downturn in business investment have contributed to sagging domestic
     demand. Devaluation of the peseta since September 1992 has made
     Spanish exports more competitive, but an export-led recovery in 1994
     will depend largely on economic recovery in Spain's major market - the
     other EU nations. A solid recovery will also require appropriate
     domestic policy actions, including controlling the budget deficit and
     wage increases, reforming labor market regulations, and possibly
     loosening monetary policy another notch. Foreign investors,
     principally from other EU countries, have invested over $60 billion in
     Spain since 1986. Despite the recession, inflation remained at about
     5% in 1993. The main source of inflationary pressure is the fiscal
     deficit.
