                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Sugarcane has
     been the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it
     accounts for 85% of exports. The government has been pushing the
     development of a tourist industry to relieve high unemployment, which
     recently amounted to one-third of the labor force. The gap in Reunion
     between the well-off and the poor is extraordinary and accounts for
     the persistent social tensions. The white and Indian communities are
     substantially better off than other segments of the population, often
     approaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups suffer the
     poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the African
     continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991 illustrates
     the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic well-being of
     Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from France.
