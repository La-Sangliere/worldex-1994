                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Cuba's heavily statist economy remains in a severe depression as a
     result of the loss of massive amounts of economic aid from the former
     Soviet Bloc. In 1989-93, GDP declined by about 40% and import
     capability fell by about 80%. Reduced imports of fuel, spare parts,
     and chemicals combined with rainy weather to cut the production of
     sugar - the country's top export - from 7 million tons in 1992 to 4.3
     million tons in 1993, causing a loss of more than $400 million in
     export revenue. The government implemented several measures designed
     to stem the economic decline, e.g., legalizing the use of foreign
     currency by Cuban citizens in August 1993 in an attempt to increase
     remittances of foreign exchange from abroad. Authorities in September
     1993 began permitting self-employment in over 100 mostly service
     occupations. Also in September the government broke up many state
     farms into smaller, more autonomous cooperative units in an attempt to
     increase worker incentives and boost depressed food production levels.
     Fuel shortages persisted throughout 1993; draft animals and bicycles
     continued to replace motor-driven vehicles, and the use of electricity
     by households and factories was cut from already low levels. With the
     help of foreign investment, tourism has been one bright spot in the
     economy, with arrivals and earnings reaching record highs in 1993.
     Government officials have expressed guarded optimism for 1994, as the
     country struggles to achieve sustainable economic growth at a
     much-reduced standard of living.
