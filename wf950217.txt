                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the former Yugoslav
     republics, with a per capita income more than twice the Yugoslav
     average, indeed not far below the levels in neighboring Austria and
     Italy. Because of its strong ties to Western Europe and the small
     scale of damage during its brief fight for independence from
     Yugoslavia, Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the former
     Yugoslav republics for economic recovery over the next few years. The
     dissolution of Yugoslavia, however, has led to severe short-term
     dislocations in production, employment, and trade ties. For example,
     overall industrial production has fallen 26% since 1990; particularly
     hard hit have been the iron and steel, machine-building, chemical, and
     textile industries. Meanwhile, the continued fighting in other former
     Yugoslav republics has led to further destruction of long-established
     trade channels and to an influx of tens of thousands of Croatian and
     Bosnian refugees. The key program for breaking up and privatizing
     major industrial firms was established in late 1992. Despite slow
     progress in privatization Slovenia has reasonable prospects for an
     upturn in 1994. Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are
     Slovenia's comparatively well-educated work force, its developed
     infrastructure, and its Western business attitudes, but instability in
     Croatia is a deterrent. Slovenia in absolute terms is a small economy,
     and a little Western investment would go a long way.
