                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and
     services. It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and
     imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In
     addition, an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the
     islands. The traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being
     replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50%
     of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root
     crops are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is
     still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly from France.
     Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production. Most
     manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially
     high among the young.
