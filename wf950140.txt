Overview:
     Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important natural
     resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light
     manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa
     (recently equal to about 45% of GDP). The great majority of households
     gain their livelihoods from subsistence farming and migrant labor; a
     large portion of the adult male workforce is employed in South African
     mines. Manufacturing depends largely on farm products to support the
     milling, canning, leather, and jute industries; other industries
     include textile, clothing, and construction (in particular, a major
     water improvement project which will permit the sale of water to South
     Africa). Industry's share of GDP rose from 6% in 1982 to 13% in 1991.
