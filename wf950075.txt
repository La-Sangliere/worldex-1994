                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993, Eritrea faces the
     bitter economic problems of a small, desperately poor African country.
     Most of the population will continue to depend on subsistence farming.
     Domestic output is substantially augmented by worker remittances from
     abroad. Government revenues come from custom duties and income and
     sales taxes. Eritrea has inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia
     and has long-term prospects for revenues from the development of
     offshore oil, offshore fishing and tourism. For the time being,
     Ethiopia will be largely dependent on Eritrean ports for its foreign
     trade.
