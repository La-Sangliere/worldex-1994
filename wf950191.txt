                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GDP,
     employs about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of
     exports, led by soybeans and cotton. Paraguay lacks substantial
     mineral or petroleum resources but possesses a large hydropower
     potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared with
     the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average annual
     rate of nearly 11%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP fell in three
     of five years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign
     debt rose. Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy
     were the completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for
     crops, and weak export prices for agricultural commodities. In 1987
     the economy experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather
     conditions and stronger international prices for key agricultural
     exports. The recovery continued through 1990, on the strength of
     bumper crops in 1988-89. In a major step to increase its economic
     activity in the region, Paraguay in March 1991 joined the Southern
     Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes Brazil, Argentina, and
     Uruguay. In 1992, the government, through an unorthodox approach,
     reduced external debt with both commercial and official creditors by
     purchasing a sizable amount of the delinquent commercial debt in the
     secondary market at a substantial discount. The government had paid
     100% of remaining official debt arrears to the US, Germany, France,
     and Spain. All commercial debt arrears have been rescheduled. For the
     long run, the government must press forward with general,
     market-oriented economic reforms. Growth of 3.5% in 1993 was spurred
     by higher-than-expected agricultural output and rising international
     commodity prices. Inflation picked up steam in fourth quarter 1993
     because of rises in public sector salaries and utility rates.
