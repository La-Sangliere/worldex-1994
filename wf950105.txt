                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     About 75% of the population live in abject poverty. Agriculture is
     mainly small-scale subsistence farming and employs nearly
     three-fourths of the work force. The majority of the population does
     not have ready access to safe drinking water, adequate medical care,
     or sufficient food. Few social assistance programs exist, and the lack
     of employment opportunities remains one of the most critical problems
     facing the economy, along with soil erosion and political instability.
     Trade sanctions applied by the Organization of American States in
     response to the September 1991 coup against President ARISTIDE have
     further damaged the economy. Output continued to drop in 1993 although
     not as sharply as in 1992.
