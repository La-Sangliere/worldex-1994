                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of economic
     development, Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few
     basic industries. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop,
     which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange earnings. The ability to
     pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of
     the climate and the international coffee market. As part of its
     economic reform agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World
     Bank support, Burundi is trying to diversify its agricultural exports
     and attract foreign investment in industry. Several state-owned coffee
     companies were privatized via public auction in September 1991.
