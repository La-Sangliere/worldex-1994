Overview:
     Tokelau's small size, isolation, and lack of resources greatly
     restrain economic development and confine agriculture to the

     maintain public services, annual aid being substantially greater than
     GDP. The principal sources of revenue come from sales of copra,
     postage stamps, souvenir coins, and handicrafts. Money is also
     remitted to families from relatives in New Zealand.
