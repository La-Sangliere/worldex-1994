                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population, and wide expanses of
     unproductive land have constrained economic development. Economic
     activity traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding
     of livestock - Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person
     in the world. In past years extensive mineral resources had been
     developed with Soviet support; total Soviet assistance at its height
     amounted to 30% of GDP. The mining and processing of coal, copper,
     molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part of
     industrial production. Timber and fishing are also important sectors.
     The Mongolian leadership is trying to make the transition from
     Soviet-style central planning to a market economy through
     privatization and price reform, and is soliciting support from
     international financial agencies and foreign investors. The economy,
     however, has still not recovered from the loss of Soviet aid, and the
     country continues to suffer substantial economic hardships.
