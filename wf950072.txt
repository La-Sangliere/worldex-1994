                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third World
     economies, most industrial plants being owned by the government.
     Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign
     investment. Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s
     and early 1980s, but in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an
     increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin
     negotiations with the IMF for balance-of-payments support. Egypt's
     first IMF standby arrangement concluded in mid-1987 was suspended in
     early 1988 because of the government's failure to adopt promised
     reforms. Egypt signed a follow-on program with the IMF and also
     negotiated a structural adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991.
     In 1991-93 the government made solid progress on administrative
     reforms such as liberalizing exchange and interest rates but resisted
     implementing major structural reforms like streamlining the public
     sector. As a result, the economy has not gained momentum and
     unemployment has become a growing problem. Egypt probably will
     continue making uneven progress in implementing the successor programs
     with the IMF and World Bank it signed onto in late 1993. In 1992-93
     tourism plunged 20% or so because of sporadic attacks by Islamic
     extremists on tourist groups. President MUBARAK has cited population
     growth as the main cause of the country's economic troubles. The
     addition of about 1.4 million people a year to the already huge
     population of 60 million exerts enormous pressure on the 5% of the
     land area available for agriculture.
