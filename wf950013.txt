Overview:
     Under the old central planning system, Armenia had built up a
     developed industrial sector, supplying machine building equipment,
     textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange
     for raw materials and energy resources. Armenia is a large food
     importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The
     economic decline in the past three years (1991-93) has been
     particularly severe due to the ongoing conflict over the Armenian
     enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey have
     blockaded pipeline and railroad traffic to Armenia for its support of
     the Karabakh Armenians. This has left Armenia with only sporadic
     deliveries of natural gas through unstable Georgia, while other fuel
     and raw materials are in critical short supply. Inflation, roughly 14%
     per month in the first nine months of 1993, surged even higher in the
     fourth quarter. In late 1993, most industrial enterprises were either
     shut down or operating at drastically reduced levels. Only small
     quantities of food were available (mostly humanitarian aid), heat was
     nonexistent, and electricity strictly rationed. An economic recovery
     cannot be expected until the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is settled and
     until transportation through Georgia improves.
National product:
     GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $7.1 billion (1993 estimate from
     the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and
     published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993; and as
     extrapolated to 1993 using official Armenian statistics, which are
     very uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)
