                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the
     economy. The government's policy of offering incentives to
     high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on the
     island has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in
     high-income industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the
     mainstays of the economy, have declined in their shares of GNP.
     Banking now contributes about 45% to GNP. Trade is mostly with the UK.
     The Isle of Man enjoys free access to European Union markets.
