                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united
     Yemen, the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities,
     is the economic and commercial capital. Future economic development
     depends heavily on Western-assisted development of its moderate oil
     resources. Former South Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed partly
     from the steady decline in Soviet economic support. The low level of
     domestic industry and agriculture have made northern Yemen dependent
     on imports for practically all of its essential needs. Large trade
     deficits have been compensated for by remittances from Yemenis working
     abroad and by foreign aid. Because of the Gulf crisis, remittances
     have dropped substantially. Once self-sufficient in food production,
     northern Yemen has become a major importer. Land once used for export
     crops - cotton, fruit, and vegetables - has been turned over to
     growing a shrub called qat, whose leaves are chewed for their
     stimulant effect by Yemenis and which has no  significant export
     market. Economic growth in former South Yemen has been constrained by
     a lack of incentives, partly stemming from centralized control over
     production decisions, investment allocation, and import choices.
     Nominal growth in 1994-95 is apt to be under 3% annually because of
     low oil prices and political deadlock that is causing a lack of
     economic cooperation and leadership.
