                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Since 1983 the economy has shown an impressive average annual growth
     rate of almost 5% because of strong agricultural and tourist sectors.
     Saint Lucia also possesses an expanding industrial base supported by
     foreign investment in manufacturing and other activities, such as data
     processing. The economy, however, remains vulnerable because the
     important agricultural sector is dominated by banana production, which
     is subject to periodic droughts and tropical storms. The economy
     exhibited relatively strong growth in 1992-93 based on a recovery of
     the agricultural and manufacturing sectors and continued growth in
     construction and tourism.
