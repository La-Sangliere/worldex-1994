                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability, adverse
     weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances from abroad, and
     counterproductive economic policies. The economy is dominated by
     governmental entities that account for more than 70% of new
     investment. The private sector's main areas of activity are
     agriculture and trading, with most private industrial investment
     predating 1980. The economy's base is agriculture, which employs 80%
     of the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items.
     Sluggish economic performance over the past decade, attributable
     largely to declining annual rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita
     income and consumption. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages
     continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary
     Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because
     of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund. The government
     implemented a comprehensive economic reform program in 1992 that
     included slashing the fiscal deficit, liberalizing foreign exchange
     regulations, and lifting most price controls, but it had backtracked
     on most reforms by mid-1993 because of its fear of generating a
     domestic backlash. The government's failure to pursue economic reform,
     its continued prosecution of the civil war, and its growing
     international isolation have led to a further deterioration of the
     non-agricultural sectors of the economy during 1993. Agriculture, on
     the other hand, after several disappointing years, enjoyed favorable
     growing conditions in 1993, and its strong performance produced an
     overall growth rate in GNP of about 7%.
