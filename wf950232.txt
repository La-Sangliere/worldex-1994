                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Tajikistan had the lowest per capita GDP in the former USSR, the
     highest rate of population growth, and the lowest standard of living.
     Its economy at the start of 1994 is producing at roughly the 1989
     level and faces urgent reconstruction tasks from the 1992 civil war.
     Tajikistan's economy was severely disrupted by the breakup of the
     Soviet economy, which provided guaranteed trade relations and heavy
     subsidies and in which specialized tasks were assigned to each
     republic. Its economy is highly agricultural (43% of the work force);
     it has specialized in growing cotton for export and must import a
     large share of its food. Its industry (14% of the work force) produces
     aluminum, hydropower, machinery, and household appliances. Nearly all
     petroleum products must be imported. Constant political turmoil and
     continued dominance of former Communist officials have slowed the
     process of economic reform and brought near economic collapse while
     limiting foreign assistance. Tajikistan is in the midst of a prolonged
     monetary crisis in which it is attempting to continue to use the
     Russian ruble as its currency while its neighbors have switched to new
     independent currencies; Russia is unwilling to advance sufficient
     rubles without attaching stringent reform conditions.
National product:
     GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $6.9 billion (1993 estimate from
     the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and
