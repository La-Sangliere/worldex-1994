Overview:
     Domestic output in this primarily agricultural economy failed to grow
     in 1992 and rose only slightly in 1993. Drought and power supply
     problems hampered production, while inadequate revenues prevented
     government pump priming. Worker remittances helped to supplement GDP.
     A marked increase in capital goods imports, particularly power
     generating equipment, telecommunications equipment, and electronic
     data processors, contributed to 20% import growth in both 1992 and
     1993.
