                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly literate
     population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified
     industrial base. Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and
     statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was plagued with huge
     external debts and recurring bouts of hyperinflation. Elected in 1989,
     in the depths of recession, President MENEM has implemented a
     comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of
     putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable growth. Argentina's
     currency has traded at par with the US dollar since April 1991, and
     inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20 years. Argentines have
     responded to the relative price stability by repatriating flight
     capital and investing in domestic industry. Growth slowed somewhat in
     1993 but Argentina still registered an impressive 6% advance, fueled
     largely by inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption
     spending. The government's major short term objective is encouraging
     exports, e.g., by reducing domestic costs of production. Much remains
     to be done in the 1990s in dismantling the old statist barriers to
     growth and in solidifying the recent economic gains.
