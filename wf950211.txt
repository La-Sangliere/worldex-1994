                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     After 14 years of mixed compliance with IMF and World Bank economic
     reform programs, Senegal finds its economy remains hostage to negative
     economic forces. Declining terms of trade, weather-related setbacks,
     and relentless growth in population have held back overall growth and
     left per capita incomes stagnant, if not diminished. The economy
     continues to rely on exports of fish, peanuts, and phosphates for hard
     currency earnings. A 50% devaluation of the African franc in January
     1994 is likely to lead to substantial increases in local currency
     prices for producers that may spur improved production. A sheltered
     import-substitution sector, comprising textiles, shoes, and other
     light manufacturing, will remain plagued, however, by high labor,
     transportation, and energy costs. Public finances face a decade-long
     trend in declining tax revenues, making the government increasingly
     dependent on official development assistance from bilateral donors.
