                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or
     nontariff barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw
     materials must be imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 17% of
     GDP. Goods and services exports account for about 50% of GDP. Real GDP
     growth averaged a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90,
     and picked up to 4.2% in 1991, 5.0% in 1992, and 5.2% in 1993.
     Unemployment, which has been declining since the mid-1980s, is now
     about 2%. A shortage of labor continues to put upward pressure on
     prices and the cost of living. Short-term prospects remain bright so
     long as major trading partners continue to be reasonably prosperous.
