                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large subsistence
     sector. Sugar exports and tourism are the major sources of foreign
     exchange. Industry contributes 13% to GDP, with sugar processing
     accounting for one-third of industrial activity. Roughly 250,000
     tourists visit each year. Political uncertainty and drought, however,
     contribute to substantial fluctuations in earnings from tourism and
     sugar. In 1992, growth was approximately 3%, based on growth in
     tourism and a lessening of labor-management disputes in the sugar and
     gold-mining sectors. In 1993, the government's budgeted growth rate of
     3% was not achieved because of a decline in non-sugar agricultural
     output and damage from Cyclone Kina.
