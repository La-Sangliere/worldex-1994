Overview:
     Coal mining is the major economic activity on Svalbard. By treaty (9
     February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have equal rights
     to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although
     US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the
     only companies still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements
     on Svalbard are essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned
     coal company employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the
     island, runs many of the local services, and provides most of the
     local infrastructure. There is also some trapping of seal, polar bear,
     fox, and walrus.
