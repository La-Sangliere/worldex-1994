                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     The oil-rich Nigerian economy continues to be hobbled by poor
     macroeconomic management that has resulted in an average annual
     inflation rate of 60%, a growing foreign debt, and a worsening balance
     of payments. A deepening political crisis in 1993 has compounded the
     government's failure to reign in deficit spending, which prevents it
     from reaching an agreement with the IMF and its bilateral creditors on
     debt relief. Investment in both oil and non-oil sector industry has
     been undermined by corruption and squandered on white elephant
     projects that have failed to generate diversification or new
     employment.
