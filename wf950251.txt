                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Uruguay is a small economy with favorable climate, good soils, and
     solid hydropower potential. Economic development has been held back by
     excessive government regulation of economic detail and 50% to 130%
     inflation. After several years of sluggish growth, real GDP jumped by
     about 7.5% in 1992. The rise is attributable mainly to an increase in
     Argentine demand for Uruguayan exports, particularly agricultural
     products and electricity. In a major step toward greater regional
     economic cooperation, Uruguay in 1991 had joined Brazil, Argentina,
     and Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur). A
     referendum in December 1992 overturned key portions of landmark
     privatization legislation, dealing a serious blow to President
     LACALLE's broad economic reform plan. Hampered by a slowdown in the
     agricultural sector, the economy grew at only 2% in 1993 compared with
     7.5% in 1992. Although inflation declined for the second consecutive
     year, a surge in the money supply, rising food prices, a record trade
     deficit, and an increase in the government deficit toward the end of
     the year foreshadowed troubles ahead in 1994.
