                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana has been
     implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983,
     including moves toward privatization and relaxation of government
     controls. The agriculture sector consists largely of small traditional
     farm holdings, rain-fed for the most part. Heavily dependent on cocoa,
     gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not spread
     substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending
     peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a
     democratic government have boosted government expenditures and
     undercut structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange
     in 1990 and plans to float 5% of its stake in Ashanti Goldfields
     Corporation, which would make the exchange the largest in sub-Saharan
     Africa outside of South Africa.
