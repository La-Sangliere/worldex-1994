                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or indirectly
     employs most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to meet
     domestic consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are
     primarily those for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments
     of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins.
     Rich stocks of fish in the surrounding waters are not presently
     exploited by the islanders. So far, efforts to establish a domestic
     fishing industry have been unsuccessful. In 1987 the government began
     selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the
     Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees amount to more
     than $40 million per year and are a primary source of income for the
     government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development
     Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the
     abundant wildlife and trout fishing.
