Note:
     Bosnia and Herzegovina is suffering from interethnic civil strife
     which began in March 1992 after the Government of Bosnia and
     Herzegovina held a referendum on independence. Bosnia's Serbs -
     supported by neighboring Serbia - responded with armed resistance
     aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining
     Serb-held areas to a "greater Serbia." Since the onset of the
     conflict, which has driven approximately half of the pre-war
     population of 4.4 million from their homes, both the Bosnian Serbs and
     the Bosnian Croats have asserted control of more than three-quarters
     of the territory formerly under the control of the Government of
     Bosnia and Herzegovina. The UN and the EU are continuing to try to
     mediate a plan for peace. In March 1994 Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian
     Croats signed an agreement in Washington, DC, creating a Federation of
     Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is to include territories in which
     Muslims or Croats predominated, according to the 1991 census. Bosnian
     Serbs refused to become a part of this Federation.

     ZUBAK, and a Muslim vice president, Ejup GANIC, were elected. Haris
     SILAJDZIC, who is prime minister of the Republic, is also the prime
     minister of the Federation.

                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former Yugoslav Republic of
     Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav federation.
     Although agriculture has been almost all in private hands, farms have
     been small and inefficient, and the republic traditionally has been a
     net importer of food. Industry has been greatly overstaffed, one
     reflection of the rigidities of Communist central planning and
     management. Tito had pushed the development of military industries in
     the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of
     Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of April 1994, Bosnia and Herzegovina
     was being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic warfare that
     has caused production to plummet, unemployment and inflation to soar,
     and human misery to multiply. No reliable economic statistics for
     1992-93 are available, although output clearly has fallen
     substantially below the levels of earlier years.

     and aircraft assembly, domestic appliances), oil refining (1991)
Agriculture:
     accounted for 9.0% of GDP in 1989; regularly produces less than 50% of
     food needs; the foothills of northern Bosnia support orchards,
     vineyards, livestock, and some wheat and corn; long winters and heavy
     precipitation leach soil fertility reducing agricultural output in the
     mountains; farms are mostly privately held, small, and not very
     productive (1991)
