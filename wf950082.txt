                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market economy, with
     per capita output two-thirds of the US figure. Its key economic sector
     is manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and engineering
     industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods representing
     about 30% of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland
     depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for
     manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development
     is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. The
     economy, which experienced an average of 4.9% annual growth between
     1987 and 1989, sank into deep recession in 1991 as growth contracted
     by 6.5%. The recession - which continued in 1992 with growth
     contracting by 4.1% - has been caused by economic overheating,
     depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter system
     between Finland and the former Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and
     gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish
     Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness
     and efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in
     public expenditures, partial privatization of state enterprises, and
     changes in monetary policy. In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka
     to the European Union's (EU) European Currency Unit (ECU) to promote
     stability. Ongoing speculation resulting from a lack of confidence in
     the government's policies forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by
     about 12% in November 1991 and to indefinitely break the link in
     September 1992. The devaluations have boosted the competitiveness of
     Finnish exports to the extent the recession bottomed out in 1993 with
     renewed economic growth expected in 1994. Unemployment probably will
     remain a serious problem during the next few years, with the majority
     of Finnish firms facing a weak domestic market and the troubled German
     and Swedish export markets. Declining revenues, increased transfer
     payments, and extensive funding to bail out the banking system pushed
     the central government's budget deficit to nearly 13% in 1993.
     Helsinki continues to harmonize its economic policies with those of
     the EU during Finland's current EU membership bid. In early 1995,
     Finland is expected to join the European Union (formerly the European
     Community), thus broadening European economic unity.
