Overview:
     The economy is heavily dependent on the mining industry to extract and
     process minerals for export. Mining accounts for almost 25% of GDP.
     Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa
     and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial diamond
     deposits are among the richest in the world, making Namibia a primary
     source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large
     quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten. More than half
     the population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence
     agriculture) for its livelihood.
