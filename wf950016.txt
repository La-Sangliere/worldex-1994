                                 Geography
 
Location:
     body of water between the Western Hemisphere and Europe/Africa
Map references:
     Africa, Antarctic Region, Arctic Region, Central America and the
     Caribbean, Europe, North America, South America, Standard Time Zones
     of the World
Area:
total area:
     82.217 million sq km
comparative area:
     slightly less than nine times the size of the US; second-largest of
     the world's four oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than
     Indian Ocean or Arctic Ocean)
note:
     includes Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait, Denmark
     Strait, Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea,
     Norwegian Sea, Scotia Sea, Weddell Sea, and other tributary water
     bodies
Coastline:
     111,866 km
International disputes:
     some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate:
     tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of Africa near
     Cape Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea; hurricanes can
     occur from May to December, but are most frequent from August to
     November
Terrain:
     surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark Strait,
     and Baltic Sea from October to June; clockwise warm water gyre (broad,
     circular system of currents) in the north Atlantic, counterclockwise
     warm water gyre in the south Atlantic; the ocean floor is dominated by
     the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a rugged north-south centerline for the entire
     Atlantic basin; maximum depth is 8,605 meters in the Puerto Rico
     Trench
Natural resources:
     oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales), sand and
     gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, precious
     stones
Environment:
current issues:
     endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions,
     turtles, and whales; municipal sludge pollution off eastern US,
     southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in Caribbean
     Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea;
     industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in Baltic Sea, North
     Sea, and Mediterranean Sea
natural hazards:
     icebergs common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and the northwestern
     Atlantic Ocean from February to August and have been spotted as far
     south as Bermuda and the Madeira Islands; icebergs from Antarctica
     occur in the extreme southern Atlantic Ocean
 
 
international agreements:
     NA
Note:
     ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme north Atlantic from
     October to May and extreme south Atlantic from May to October;
     persistent fog can be a hazard to shipping from May to September;
     major choke points include the Dardanelles, Strait of Gibraltar,
     access to the Panama and Suez Canals; strategic straits include the
     Strait of Dover, Straits of Florida, Mona Passage, The Sound
     (Oresund), and Windward Passage; north Atlantic shipping lanes subject
     to icebergs from February to August; the Equator divides the Atlantic
     Ocean into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean

                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The Atlantic Ocean provides some of the world's most heavily
     trafficked sea routes, between and within the Eastern and Western
     Hemispheres. Other economic activity includes the exploitation of
     natural resources, e.g., fishing, the dredging of aragonite sands (The
     Bahamas), and production of crude oil and natural gas (Caribbean Sea,
     Gulf of Mexico, and North Sea).
