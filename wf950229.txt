                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War I
     through World War II, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of
     living under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive
     welfare benefits. It has a modern distribution system, excellent
     internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force.
     Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an
     economy that is heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned
     firms account for about 90% of industrial output, of which the
     engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. In the last
     few years, however, this extraordinarily favorable picture has been
     clouded by inflation, growing unemployment, and a gradual loss of
     competitiveness in international markets. Although Prime Minister
     BILDT's center-right minority coalition had hoped to charge ahead with
     free-market-oriented reforms, a skyrocketing budget deficit - almost
     14% of GDP in FY94 projections - and record unemployment have
     forestalled many of the plans. Unemployment in 1993 is estimated at
     around 8% with another 5% in job training. Continued heavy foreign
     exchange speculation forced the government to cooperate in late 1992
     with the opposition Social Democrats on two crisis packages - one a
     severe austerity pact and the other a program to spur industrial
     competitiveness - which basically set economic policy through 1997. In
     November 1992, Sweden broke its tie to the EC's ECU, and the krona has
     since depreciated about 25% against the dollar. The government hopes
     the boost in export competitiveness from the depreciation will help
     lift Sweden out of its 3-year recession. To curb the budget deficit
     and bolster confidence in the economy, BILDT continues to propose cuts
     in welfare benefits, subsidies, defense, and foreign aid. Sweden
     continues to harmonize its economic policies with those of the EU in
     preparation for scheduled membership by early 1995, which will help to
     broaden European economic unity.
