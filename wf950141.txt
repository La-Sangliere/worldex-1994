                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberia's economy,
     especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Businessmen have
     fled the country, taking capital and expertise with them. Many will
     not return. Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and
     a climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and
     exporter of basic products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign
     owned, had been small in scope. Political instability threatens
     prospects for economic reconstruction and repatriation of some 750,000
     Liberian refugees who have fled to neighboring countries. The
     political impasse between the interim government and rebel leader
     Charles Taylor has prevented restoration of normal economic life,
     including the re-establishment of a strong central government with
     effective economic development programs.
