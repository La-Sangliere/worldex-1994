                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     An extremely poor country by European standards, Albania is making the
     difficult transition to a more open-market economy. The economy
     rebounded in 1993 after a severe depression accompanying the collapse
     of the previous centrally planned system in 1990 and 1991.
     Stabilization policies, including public sector layoffs and reduced
     social services, have improved the government's fiscal situation and
     reduced inflation. The recovery was spurred by the remittances of some
     5% of the population which works abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy.
     Foreign assistance and humanitarian aid also supported the recovery.
     Most agricultural land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving
     peasant incomes. Albania's limited industrial sector, now less than
     one-sixth of GDP, continued to decline in 1993. A sharp fall in
     chromium prices reduced hard currency receipts from the mining sector.
     Large segments of the population, especially those living in urban
     areas, continue to depend on humanitarian aid to meet basic food
     requirements. Unemployment remains a severe problem accounting for
     approximately one-fifth of the work force. Growth is expected to
     continue in 1994, but could falter if Albania becomes involved in the
     conflict in the former Yugoslavia, workers' remittances from Greece
     are reduced, or foreign assistance declines.
