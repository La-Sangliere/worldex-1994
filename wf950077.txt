                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     With the independence of Eritrea on 27 April 1993, Ethiopia continues
     to face difficult economic problems as one of the poorest and least
     developed countries in Africa. (The accompanying analysis and figures
     predate the independence of Eritrea.) Its economy is based on
     subsistence agriculture, which accounts for about 45% of GDP, 90% of
     exports, and 80% of total employment; coffee generates 60% of export
     earnings. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs from
     the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but less
     than 10% of agriculture, is state run; the government is considering
     selling off a portion of state-owned plants. Favorable agricultural
     weather largely explains the 4.5% growth in output in FY89, whereas
     drought and deteriorating internal security conditions prevented
     growth in FY90. In 1991 the lack of law and order, particularly in the
     south, interfered with economic development and growth. In 1992,
     because of some easing of civil strife and aid from the outside world,
     the economy substantially improved.
