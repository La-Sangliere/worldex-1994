                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Moldova has pushed ahead boldly on economic reform since gaining its
     independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. It introduced a
     convertible currency - the leu - in late 1993 that has remained stable
     against the dollar, removed price controls on most products,
     eliminated licenses and quotas on most imports and exports, and freed
     interest rates. In 1994, Moldova aims to privatize at least one-third
     of state enterprises, lower inflation to 1% per month, and reduce the
     budget deficit to 3.5% of GDP. Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and
     good farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result,
     Moldova's economy is primarily based on agriculture, featuring fruits,
     vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova, however, must import all of
     its supplies of oil, coal, and natural gas, and energy shortages have
     contributed to sharp production declines since the break-up of the
     Soviet Union. Activities by separatist groups in the Dniester region
     have held back economic development in that area. Foreign economic
     assistance has been a tangible plus for Moldova, whereas direct
     foreign investment has been lacking.
