                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Since March 1991, when President CHAMORRO began an ambitious economic
     stabilization program, Nicaragua has had considerable success in
     reducing inflation and obtaining substantial economic aid from abroad.
     Annual inflation fell from more than 750% in 1991 to less than 5% in
     1992. Inflation rose again to an estimated 20% in 1993, although this
     increase was due almost entirely to a large currency devaluation in
     January. As of early 1994, the government was close to finalizing an
     enhanced structural adjustment facility with the IMF, after the
     previous standby facility expired in early 1993. Despite these
     successes, achieving overall economic growth in an economy scarred by
     misguided economic values and civil war during the 1980s has proved
     elusive. Economic growth was flat in 1992 and slightly negative in
     1993. Nicaragua's per capita foreign debt is one of the highest in the
     world; nonetheless, as of late 1993, Nicaragua was current on its
     post-1988 debt as well as on payments to the international financial
     institutions. Definition of property rights remains a problem;
     ownership disputes over large tracts of land, businesses, and homes
     confiscated by the previous government have yet to be resolved.
