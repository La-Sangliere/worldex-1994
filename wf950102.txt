Overview:
     Although possessing major mineral and hydropower resources and
     considerable potential for agricultural development, Guinea remains
     one of the poorest countries in the world. The agricultural sector
     contributes about 40% to GDP and employs more than 80% of the work
     force, while industry accounts for 27% of GDP. Guinea possesses over
     25% of the world's bauxite reserves. The mining sector accounted for
     85% of exports in 1991. Long-run improvements in literacy, financial
     institutions, and the legal framework are needed if the country is to
     move out of poverty. Except in the bauxite industry, foreign
     investment remains minimal.
