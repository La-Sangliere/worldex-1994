                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and financial
     centers, and its economy ranks among the four largest in Western
     Europe. The economy is essentially capitalistic; over the past
     thirteen years the ruling Tories have greatly reduced public ownership
     and contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is
     intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards,
     producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor force. The
     UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves, and primary energy
     production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any
     industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and
     business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP
     while industry continues to decline in importance, now employing only
     25% of the work force and generating only 21% of GDP. The economy is
     emerging out of its 3-year recession with only weak recovery in 1993;
     even so, the economy fared better in 1993 than the economies of most
     other European countries. Unemployment is hovering around 10% of the
     labor force. The government in 1992 adopted a pro-growth strategy,
     cutting interest rates sharply and removing the pound from the
     European exchange rate mechanism. Excess industrial capacity probably
     will moderate inflation which for the first time in a decade is below
     the EC average. The major economic policy question for Britain in the
     1990s is the terms on which it participates in the financial and
     economic integration of Europe.
