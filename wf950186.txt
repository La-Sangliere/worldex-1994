                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the usual problems
     of rapidly increasing population, sizable government deficits, and
     heavy dependence on foreign aid. In addition, the economy must support
     a large military establishment. Rapid economic growth, averaging 5%-6%
     over the past decade has helped Pakistan cope with these problems.
     However, growth slumped to 3% in FY93 because of severe flooding,
     which damaged the key export crop, cotton. Almost all agriculture and
     small-scale industry is in private hands. In 1990, Pakistan embarked
     on a sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and
     domestic private investment and lower foreign aid dependence. The
     SHARIF government denationalized several state-owned firms and
     attracted some foreign investment. Pakistan likely will have
     difficulty raising living standards because of its rapidly expanding
     population. At the current rate of growth, population would double in
     25 years.
