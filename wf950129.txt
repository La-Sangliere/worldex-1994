                                 Geography
 
Location:
     Central Asia, between Russia and Uzbekistan, bordering on the Caspian
     Sea and the Aral Sea
Map references:
     Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States - Central Asian States,
     Standard Time Zones of the World
Area:
total area:
     2,717,300 sq km
land area:
     2,669,800 sq km
comparative area:
     slightly less than four times the size of Texas
Land boundaries:
     total 12,012 km, China 1,533 km, Kyrgyzstan 1,051 km, Russia 6,846 km,
     Turkmenistan 379 km, Uzbekistan 2,203 km
Coastline:
     0 km
note:
     Kazakhstan borders the Aral Sea (1,015 km) and the Caspian Sea (1,894
     km)
Maritime claims:
     landlocked, but borders with Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan in
     the Caspian Sea are under negotiation at present
International disputes:
     Russia may dispute current de facto maritime border to midpoint of
     Caspian Sea from shore
Climate:
     continental, cold winters and hot summers, arid and semiarid
Terrain:
     extends from the Volga to the Altai Mountains and from the plains in
     western Siberia to oasis and desert in Central Asia
Natural resources:
     major deposits of petroleum, coal, iron ore, manganese, chrome ore,
     nickel, cobalt, copper, molybdenum, lead, zinc, bauxite, gold, uranium

Environment:
current issues:
     radioactive or toxic chemical sites associated with its former defense
     industries and test ranges are found throughout the country and pose
     health risks for humans and animals; industrial pollution is severe in
     some cities; because the two main rivers which flowed into the Aral
     Sea have been diverted for irrigation, it is drying up and leaving
     behind a harmful layer of chemical pesticides and natural salts; these
     substances are then picked up by the wind and blown into noxious dust
     storms; pollution in the Caspian Sea; soil pollution from overuse of
     agricultural chemicals and salinization from faulty irrigation
     practices
natural hazards:
     NA

                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former Soviet states in
     territory, possesses vast oil, coal, rare metals, and agricultural
     resources. While the economy is gradually making the transition from a
     Soviet command system to a market system, strong elements of state
     control persist including government ownership of most economic assets
     and a continued system of mandatory state procurement for the key
     products such as grain and energy; likewise, agriculture remains
     largely collectivized. On the other hand, new businesses are forming
     rapidly, the economy is opening to foreign investment, and 12% of
     state-owned commercial enterprises have been privatized. In 1993, a
     three-year industrial privatization program was launched; an
     independent currency was successfully introduced; and two large joint
     ventures were established with western oil companies. These
     far-reaching structural transformations have resulted in a cumulative
     decline in national income of more than 30% since 1990. Loose monetary
     policies have kept the inflation rate high, averaging 28% per month
     for 1993 and accelerating at the end with the disruption caused by a
     new currency. Since the introduction of its independent currency in
     November 1993, the government has renewed its commitment to fiscal
     discipline and accelerating economic reform. However, growing economic
     hardship and rising ethnic tensions between Kazakhs and Russians over
     the division of economic assets will likely lead to strong pressure to
     backtrack.
