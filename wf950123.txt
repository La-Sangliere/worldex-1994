                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, mastery of high
     technology, and a comparatively small defense allocation have helped
     Japan advance with extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second most
     powerful economy in the world. Industry, the most important sector of
     the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels.
     Self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its
     requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of
     the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the
     global catch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10%
     average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. Economic
     growth came to a halt in 1992-93 largely because of contractionary
     domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the
     stock and real estate markets. At the same time, the stronger yen and
     slower global growth are containing export growth. Unemployment and
     inflation remain remarkably low in comparison with the other
     industrialized nations. Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus -
     $120 billion in 1993, up more than 10% from the year earlier - which
     supports extensive investment in foreign assets. The new prime
     minister HATA in early 1994 reiterated previous governments' vows of
     administrative and economic reform, including reduction in the trade
     surplus, but his weak coalition government faces strong resistance
     from traditional interest groups. The crowding of the habitable land
     area and the aging of the population are two major long-run problems.
