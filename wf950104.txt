Overview:
     Guyana, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, has
     pushed ahead strongly in 1991-93, at 7% average annual growth rate.
     Favorable factors include recovery in the key agricultural and mining
     sectors, a more favorable atmosphere for business initiative, a more
     realistic exchange rate, a sharp drop in the inflation rate, and the
     continued support of international organizations. Serious underlying
     economic problems will continue. Electric power has been in short
     supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in national
     output. The government will have to persist in efforts to control
     external debt and inflation and to extend the privatization program.
