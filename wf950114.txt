                                 Geography
 
Location:
     body of water between Africa, Asia, Australia, and Antarctica
Map references:
     Southeast Asia, Standard Time Zones of the World
Area:
total area:
     73.6 million sq km
comparative area:
     slightly less than eight times the size of the US; third-largest ocean
     (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than the
     Arctic Ocean)
note:
     includes Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Strait of
     Malacca, Great Australian Bight, Gulf of Oman, Mozambique Channel, and
     other tributary water bodies
Coastline:
     66,526 km
International disputes:
     some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate:
     northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon (June to
     October); tropical cyclones occur during May/June and October/November
     in the north Indian Ocean and January/February in the south Indian
     Ocean
Terrain:
     surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular system of
     currents) in the south Indian Ocean; unique reversal of surface
     currents in the north Indian Ocean, low atmospheric pressure over
     southwest Asia from hot, rising, summer air results in the southwest
     monsoon and southwest-to-northeast winds and currents, while high
     pressure over northern Asia from cold, falling, winter air results in
     the northeast monsoon and northeast-to-southwest winds and currents;
     ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and subdivided
     by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge, and
     Ninety East Ridge; maximum depth is 7,258 meters in the Java Trench
Natural resources:
     oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
     deposits, polymetallic nodules
Environment:
current issues:
     endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and
     whales; oil pollution in the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea
natural hazards:
     NA
international agreements:
     NA
Note:
     major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of Hormuz, Strait of
     Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the Lombok Strait;
     ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme south near Antarctica
     from May to October

Overview:
     The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the Middle East,
     Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It carries a
     particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products from
     the oil fields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its fish are of
     great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic
     consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, Korea, and
     Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.
     Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the offshore areas
     of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western Australia. An estimated 40%
     of the world's offshore oil production comes from the Indian Ocean.
     Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are
     actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South
     Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Industries:
     based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly fish,
     minerals, oil and gas, fishing, sand and gravel
 
                              Communications
 
Ports:
     Bombay (India), Calcutta (India), Madras (India), Colombo (Sri Lanka),
     Durban (South Africa), Fremantle (Australia), Jakarta (Indonesia),
     Melbourne (Australia), Richards Bay (South Africa)
Telecommunications:
     submarine cables from India to United Arab Emirates and Malaysia, and
     from Sri Lanka to Djibouti and Indonesia
