                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economic and social infrastructure is not well developed.
     Subsistence agriculture dominates the economy, generating about
     one-third of GDP and employing about two-thirds of the working
     population. Manufacturing, which accounts for roughly 10% of GDP,
     consists mainly of the processing of raw materials and of light
     manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining provides an
     important source of hard currency. In 1990-93, the government, with
     the support of the IMF and the World Bank, has made substantial
     progress toward structural reform and better fiscal management. The
     government readily met all IMF/WB targets in December 1993. The budget
     deficit had been dramatically reduced; the government workforce had
     been cut by 25%; large amounts of domestic debt had been retired;
     arrears to the IMF, World Bank, and other creditors had been reduced.
     On the negative side, continued incursions by the Liberian rebels,
     bandits, and army deserters in southern and eastern Sierra Leone have
     severely strained the economy and threaten economically critical
     regions of the country.
