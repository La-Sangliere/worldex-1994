                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian economy
     dependent on a guaranteed British market to a more industrialized,
     open free market economy that can compete on the global scene. The
     government has hoped that dynamic growth would boost real incomes,
     broaden and deepen the technological capabilities of the industrial
     sector, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the expansion of
     welfare benefits. The results have been mixed: inflation is down from
     double-digit levels, but growth was sluggish in 1988-91. In 1992-93,
     growth picked up to 3% annually, a sign that the new economic approach
     is beginning to pay off. Business confidence has strengthened, and the
     inflation remains among the lowest in the industrial world.
     Unemployment, down from 11% in 1991, remains unacceptably high at 9%.
