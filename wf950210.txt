                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 75% of budget revenues, 35%
     of GDP, and almost all export earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest
     reserves of petroleum in the world, ranks as the largest exporter of
     petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the
     government intends to bring its budget, which has been in deficit
     since 1983, back into balance, and to encourage private economic
     activity. Roughly four million foreign workers play an important role
     in the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and banking sectors. For
     about a decade, Saudi Arabia's domestic and international outlays have
     outstripped its income, and the government has cut its foreign
     assistance and is beginning to rein in domestic programs.
