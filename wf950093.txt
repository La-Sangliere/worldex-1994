                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The British military presence has been severely reduced and now only
     contributes about 11% to the local economy. The financial sector
     accounts for 15% of GDP; tourism and shipping services fees also
     generate income. Because more than 70% of the economy is in the public
     sector, changes in government spending have a major impact on the
     level of employment. Construction workers are particularly affected
     when government expenditures are cut.
