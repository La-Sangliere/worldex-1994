                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy has historically been based on cattle raising and crops.
     Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the
     population, but produces only about 50% of food needs. The driving
     force behind the rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been
     the mining industry. This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds,
     has gone from generating 25% of GDP in 1980 to 50% in 1991. No other
     sector has experienced such growth, especially not agriculture, which
     is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils. The unemployment rate
     remains a problem at 25%. Although diamond production was down
     slightly in 1992, substantial gains in coal output and manufacturing
     helped boost the economy. Recovery in sluggish diamond markets in
     second half 1993 helped Botswana achieve moderate growth of 3% for the
     year.
