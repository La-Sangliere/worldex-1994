                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Thailand's economy recovered rapidly from the political unrest in May
     1992 to post an impressive 7.5% growth rate for the year and 7.8% in
     1993. One of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, Thailand
     depends on exports of manufactures and the development of the service
     sector to fuel the country's rapid growth. The trade and current
     account deficits fell in 1992; much of Thailand's recent imports have
     been for capital equipment suggesting that the export sector is poised
     for further growth. With foreign investment slowing, Bangkok is
     working to increase the generation of domestic capital. Prime Minister
     CHUAN's government - Thailand's fifth government in less than two
     years - is pledged to continue Bangkok's probusiness policies, and the
     return of a democratically elected government has improved business
     confidence. Nevertheless, CHUAN must overcome divisions within his
     ruling coalition to complete much needed infrastructure development
     programs if Thailand is to remain an attractive place for business
     investment. Over the longer-term, Bangkok must produce more college
     graduates with technical training and upgrade workers' skills to
     continue its rapid economic development.
