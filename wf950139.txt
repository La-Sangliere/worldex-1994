Note:
     Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political institutions
     and regaining its national sovereignty since the end of the
     devastating 16-year civil war in October 1990. Under the Ta'if accord
     - the blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese have
     established a more equitable political system, particularly by giving
     Muslims a greater say in the political process. Since December 1990,
     the Lebanese have formed three cabinets and conducted the first
     legislative election in 20 years. Most of the militias have been
     weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has seized vast
     quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and extended
     central government authority over about one-half of the country.
     Hizballah, the radical Sh'ia party, retains most of its weapons.
     Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel maintains troops
     in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia, The Army
     of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous
     to its border. The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared
     security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of
     Jazzine. As of December 1993, Syria maintained about 30,000-35,000
     troops in Lebanon. These troops are based mainly in Beirut, North
     Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment was legitimized by
     the Arab League early in Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if accord.
     Citing the continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and
     failure of the Lebanese Government to implement all of the
     constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord, Damascus has so far
     refused to withdraw its troops from Beirut.

                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Since 1975 civil war has seriously damaged Lebanon's economic
     infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but ended
     Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub.
     Following October 1990, however, a tentative peace has enabled the
     central government to begin restoring control in Beirut, collect
     taxes, and regain access to key port and government facilities. The
     battered economy has also been propped up by a financially sound
     banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers.
     Family remittances, banking transactions, manufactured and farm
     exports, the narcotics trade, and international emergency aid are the
     main sources of foreign exchange. In the relatively settled year of
     1991, industrial production, agricultural output, and exports showed
     substantial gains. The further rebuilding of the war-ravaged country
     was delayed in 1992 because of an upturn in political wrangling. In
     October 1992, Rafiq HARIRI was appointed Prime Minister. HARIRI, a
     wealthy entrepreneur, has announced ambitious plans for Lebanon's
     reconstruction which involve a substantial influx of foreign aid and
     investment. Progress on restoring basic services is limited. Since
     Prime Minister HARIRI's appointment, the most significant improvement
     lies in the stabilization of the Lebanese pound, which had gained over
     30% in value by yearend 1993. The year 1993 was marked by efforts of
     the new administration to encourage domestic and foreign investment
     and to obtain additional international assistance.
