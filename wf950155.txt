                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and light
     industry. Agriculture accounts for about 10% of GDP and the small
     industrial sector for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of
     the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana exports are
     increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and
     grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a chronic trade
     deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from France.
     Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as a
     source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work force is employed
     in the service sector and in administration. Banana workers launched
     protests late in 1992 because of falling banana prices and fears of
     greater competition in the European market from other producers.
