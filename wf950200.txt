Overview:
     Despite the continuing difficulties in moving away from the former
     command system, the Romanian economy seems to have bottomed out in
     1993. Market oriented reforms have been introduced fitfully since the
     downfall of CEAUSESCU in December 1989, with the result a growing
     private sector, especially in services. The slow pace of structural
     reform, however, has exacerbated Romania's high inflation rate and
     eroded real wages. Agricultural production rebounded in 1993 from the
     previous year's drought-reduced harvest; food supplies are adequate,
     but expensive. Bucharest resisted pressure to devalue its currency
     despite a $638 million trade deficit in the first half of 1993 and the
     emergence of a black market for hard currency. Unable to support the
     currency, the national bank, nonetheless, was forced to depreciate the
     currency 65% over the course of the year. The return of winter
     revealed that much of Romania's infrastructure had deteriorated over
     the last four years due to reduced levels of public investment.
     Residents of the capital reported frequent disruptions of heating and
     water services.
