comparative area:
     about half the size of Russia; about three-tenths the size of Africa;
     about one-half the size of South America (or slightly larger than
     Brazil); slightly smaller than China; about two and one-half times the
     size of Western Europe
note:

Climate:
     mostly temperate, but tropical in Hawaii and Florida and arctic in
     Alaska, semiarid in the great plains west of the Mississippi River and

                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically advanced
     economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $24,700, the largest
     among major industrial nations. The economy is market oriented with
     most decisions made by private individuals and business firms and with
     government purchases of goods and services made predominantly in the
     marketplace. In 1989 the economy enjoyed its seventh successive year
     of substantial growth, the longest in peacetime history. The expansion
     featured moderation in wage and consumer price increases and a steady
     reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of the labor force. In 1990,
     however, growth slowed to 1% because of a combination of factors, such
     as the worldwide increase in interest rates, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
     in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and a general decline
     in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output fell by 1%,
     unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved premature. Growth
     picked up to 2.6% in 1992 and to 3.0% in 1993. Unemployment, however,
     declined only gradually, the increase in GDP being mainly attributable
     to gains in output per worker. Ongoing economic problems for the
     remainder of the 1990s include inadequate investment in economic
     infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs, and sizable budget and
     trade deficits.
