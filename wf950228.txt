                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which occupies more
     than 60% of the population and contributes nearly 25% to GDP.
     Manufacturing, which includes a number of agroprocessing factories,
     accounts for another quarter of GDP. Mining has declined in importance
     in recent years; high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted in 1978,
     and health concerns cut world demand for asbestos. Exports of sugar
     and forestry products are the main earners of hard currency.
     Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with Mozambique,
     Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it receives
     90% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports.
