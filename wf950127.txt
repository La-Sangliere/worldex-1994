Overview:
     Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the
     late 1970s and early 1980s, when its annual real GNP growth averaged
     more than 10%. In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in
     both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real economic growth to an
     average of roughly 2% per year. Imports - mainly oil, capital goods,
     consumer durables, and food - outstripped exports, with the difference
     covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian
     Government began debt-rescheduling negotiations and agreed to
     implement an IMF-supported program designed to gradually reduce the
     budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The
     Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated
     Jordan's already serious economic problems, forcing the government to
     shelve the IMF program, stop most debt payments, and suspend
     rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker
     remittances and trade contracted, and refugees flooded the country,
     producing serious balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth,
     and straining government resources. The economy rebounded in 1992,
     largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers returning
     from the Gulf, but the recovery has been losing steam since mid-1993.
     The government is implementing the reform program adopted in 1992 and
     continues to secure rescheduling of its heavy foreign debt.
