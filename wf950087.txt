                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Notwithstanding its serious ongoing economic problems, Gabon enjoys a
     per capita income more than twice that of most nations of sub-Saharan
     Africa. Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil was
     discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector now accounts
     for 50% of GNP. Real growth was feeble in 1992 and Gabon continues to
     face weak prices for its timber, manganese, and uranium exports.
     Despite an abundance of natural wealth, and a manageable rate of
     population growth, the economy is hobbled by poor fiscal management.
     In 1992, the fiscal deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed
     to settled arrears on its bilateral debt, leading to a cancellation of
     rescheduling agreements with official and private creditors.
     Devaluation of the local currency by 50% in January 1994 could set off
     an inflationary spiral if the government fails to reign in spending
     and grants large wage increases to an already overpaid public sector
     workforce.
