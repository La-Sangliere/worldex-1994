                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Petroleum is the backbone of the economy, accounting for 23% of GDP,
     61% of central government ordinary revenues, and 77% of export
     earnings in 1993. Former President PEREZ introduced an economic
     readjustment program when he assumed office in February 1989. Lower
     tariffs and the removal of price controls, a free market exchange
     rate, and market-linked interest rates threw the economy into
     confusion, causing an 8% decline in GDP in 1989. The economy recovered
     part way in 1990 and grew by 9.7% in 1991 and 6.8% in 1992; economic
     activity fell by 1% in 1993, primarily because of business concerns
     over political instability.
