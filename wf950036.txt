                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing sectors,
     entered the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an
     unserviceable foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack of policy
     direction. In addition, the economy remained highly regulated,
     inward-looking, and protected by substantial trade and investment
     barriers. Ownership of major industrial and mining facilities is
     divided among private interests - including several multinationals -
     and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are private, with
     the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts between
     large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent
     violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed office in March 1990,
     launched an ambitious reform program that sought to modernize and
     reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the
     economy, and opening it to increased foreign competition. The
     government also obtained an IMF standby loan in January 1992 and
     reached agreements with commercial bankers on the repayment of
     interest arrears and on the reduction of debt and debt service
     payments. Galloping inflation (the rate doubled in 1992 and by March
     1994 had risen to 42% per month) continues to undermine economic
     stability. Itamar FRANCO, who assumed the presidency following
     President COLLOR'S resignation in December 1992, was out of step with
     COLLOR'S reform agenda; initiatives to redress fiscal problems,
     privatize state enterprises, and liberalize trade and investment
     policies have lost momentum. Brazil's natural resources remain a
     major, long-term economic strength
