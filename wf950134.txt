                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The driving force behind the economy's dynamic growth has been the
     planned development of an export-oriented economy in a vigorously
     entrepreneurial society. Real GNP increased more than 10% annually
     between 1986 and 1991. This growth ultimately led to an overheated
     situation characterized by a tight labor market, strong inflationary
     pressures, and a rapidly rising current account deficit. As a result,
     in 1992, economic policy focused on slowing the growth rate of
     inflation and reducing the deficit. Annual growth slowed to 5%, still
     above the rate in most other countries of the world. Growth increased
     to 6.3% in 1993 as a result of fourth quarter manufacturing production
     growth of over 10% and is expected to be in the 8% range for 1994.
