                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export earners are
     fruit, copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a
     fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Economic
     development is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign
     markets and a lack of natural resources and good transportation links.
     A large trade deficit is annually made up for by remittances from
     emigrants and from foreign aid, largely from New Zealand. Current
     economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential
     and expanding the fishing industry.
