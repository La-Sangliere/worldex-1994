                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Benin is one of the least developed countries in the world because of
     limited natural resources and a poorly developed infrastructure.
     Agriculture accounts for about 35% of GDP, employs about 60% of the
     labor force, and generates a major share of foreign exchange earnings.
     The industrial sector contributes only about 10% to GDP and employs 2%
     of the work force. Low prices in recent years have kept down hard
     currency earnings from Benin's major exports of agricultural products,
     primarily cotton. A World Bank supported structural adjustment program
     begun in 1989 has helped strengthen the economy through such measures
     as trimming the government payroll, reforming the tax system, and
     encouraging private investment, both domestic and foreign. Benin has
     experienced 3 consecutive years of moderate growth as a result.
