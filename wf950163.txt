Overview:
     Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a popular
     resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The
     Principality has successfully sought to diversify into services and
     small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state has no
     income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for
     individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies
     that have set up businesses and offices. About 50% of Monaco's annual
     revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels, banks, and the
     industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from tourism. Living
     standards are high, that is, roughly comparable to those in prosperous
     French metropolitan suburbs.
