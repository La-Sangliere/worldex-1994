                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a
     per capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West European
     countries. Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of
     agricultural products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Primary
     products account for more than 60% of the value of total exports, so
     that, as in 1983-84, a downturn in world commodity prices can have a
     big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for increased
     exports of manufactured goods, but competition in international
     markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered from the low
     growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD countries in the
     early 1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly from the
     prolonged recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor being weak
     world demand for Australia's exports. Unemployment has hovered around
     10% and probably will remain at that level in 1994 as productivity
     gains rather than more jobs account for growth.
