                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Climate, geographic remoteness, poor resource endowment, and lack of
     infrastructure make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in
     the world. Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil, conflict with
     Libya, drought, and food shortages. Consequently the economy has shown
     little progress in recent years in overcoming a severe setback brought
     on by civil war in the late 1980s. Over 80% of the work force is
     involved in subsistence farming and fishing. Cotton is the major cash
     crop, accounting for at least half of exports. Chad is highly
     dependent on foreign aid, especially food credits, given chronic
     shortages in several regions. The government hopes that discovery of
     several oil deposits near Lake Chad will lead to economic revival and
     a windfall in government revenues by 2000.
