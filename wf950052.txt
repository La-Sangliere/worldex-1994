                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been trying to move
     the economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy
     to a more productive and flexible economy with market elements, but
     still within the framework of monolithic Communist control. To this
     end the authorities switched to a system of household responsibility
     in agriculture in place of the old collectivization, increased the
     authority of local officials and plant managers in industry, permitted
     a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services and light
     manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased foreign trade and
     investment. The result has been a strong surge in production,
     particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s. Industry also has
     posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and
     opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and modern production
     methods have helped spur production of both domestic and export goods.
     Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On the darker side,
     the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the worst
     results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of
     capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has
     periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at intervals.
     In 1992-93 annual growth of GDP has accelerated, particularly in the
     coastal areas - to more than 10% annually according to official
     claims. In late 1993 China's leadership approved additional reforms
     aimed at giving more play to market-oriented institutions and at
     strengthening the center's control over the financial system. Popular
     resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural
     cadres have weakened China's population control program, which is
     essential to the nation's long-term economic viability.
