                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic of Croatia, after
     Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized area, with a per
     capita output roughly comparable to that of Portugal and perhaps
     one-third above the Yugoslav average. At present, Croatian Serb
     Nationalists control approximately one-third of the Croatian
     territory, and one of the overriding determinants of Croatia's
     long-term political and economic prospects will be the resolution of
     this territorial dispute. Croatia faces monumental economic problems
     stemming from: the legacy of longtime Communist mismanagement of the
     economy; large foreign debt; damage during the fighting to bridges,
     factories, power lines, buildings, and houses; the large refugee
     population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and the disruption of economic
     ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav republics, as well as
     within its own territory. At the minimum, extensive Western aid and
     investment, especially in the tourist and oil industries, would seem
     necessary to salvage a desperate economic situation. However, peace
     and political stability must come first; only then will recent
     government moves toward a "market-friendly" economy reverse the sharp
     drop in output. As of May 1994, fighting continues among Croats,
     Serbs, and Muslims, and national boundaries and final political
     arrangements are still in doubt.
