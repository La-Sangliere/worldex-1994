Overview:
     Economic activity is limited to commercial fishing. The proximity to
     nearby oil- and gas-producing sedimentary basins suggests the
     potential for oil and gas deposits, but the region is largely
     unexplored, and there are no reliable estimates of potential reserves;
     commercial exploitation has yet to be developed.

     none
 
                              Communications
