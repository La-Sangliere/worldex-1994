                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector; coffee and tea
     make up 80-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile land is
     limited, however, and deforestation and soil erosion have created
     problems. The industrial sector in Rwanda is small, contributing only
     17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of
     agricultural products. The Rwandan economy remains dependent on
     coffee/tea exports and foreign aid. Weak international prices since
     1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to
     decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in
     October 1990. Ethnic-based insurgency in 1990-93 devastated wide areas
     of the north and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. A peace
     accord in mid-1993 temporarily ended most of the fighting, but massive
     resumption of civil warfare in April 1994 in the capital city Kigali
     has been taking thousands of lives and severely damaging short-term
     economic prospects

     self-sufficiency declining; country imports foodstuffs as farm
     production fails to keep up with a 2.8% annual growth in population
