                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and
     fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting,
     except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry
     exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate
     facilities hinder development. Financial assistance from the US is the
     primary source of revenue, with the US pledged to spend $1 billion in
     the islands in the l990s. Geographical isolation and a poorly
     developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term growth.
