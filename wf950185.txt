                                 Geography
 
Location:
     body of water between the Western Hemisphere, Asia, and Australia
Map references:
     Asia, North America, Oceania, South America, Standard Time Zones of
     the World
Area:
total area:
     165.384 million sq km
comparative area:
     about 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean (followed by the
     Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean); covers about
     one-third of the global surface; larger than the total land area of
     the world
note:
     includes Bali Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering Strait,
     Coral Sea, East China Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of Tonkin, Java Sea,
     Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk,
     South China Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other tributary water
     bodies
Coastline:
     135,663 km
International disputes:
     some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate:
     the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy season occurs during the
     summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the
     land, and a dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow
     from the Asian land mass back to the ocean
Terrain:
     surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a clockwise,
     warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in the
     southern Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the
     northern Pacific sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in
     winter; in the southern Pacific sea ice from Antarctica reaches its
     northernmost extent in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific
     is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is
     dissected by deep trenches, including the world's deepest, the 10,924
     meter Marianas Trench
Natural resources:
     oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates,
     placer deposits, fish
Environment:
current issues:
     endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter,
     seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South
     China Sea
 
 
natural hazards:
     surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and earthquake activity
     sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire; subject to tropical
     cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east Asia from May to December
     (most frequent from July to October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes)
     may form south of Mexico and strike Central America and Mexico from
     June to October (most common in August and September); southern
     shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica; occasional El Nino
     phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade winds slacken
     and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, killing the
     plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies; consequently,
     the anchovies move to better feeding grounds, causing resident marine
     birds to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source
international agreements:
     NA
Note:
     the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon
     Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific
     Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; ships
     subject to superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May
     and in extreme south from May to October; persistent fog in the
     northern Pacific from June to December is a hazard to shipping; dotted
     with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in the southwestern
 
                                Government

                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
     particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides
     low-cost sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing
     grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel
     for the construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's
     fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where
     the fish catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of
     offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in
     the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China, US, and Peru. The high
     cost of recovering offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings
     in world prices for oil since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new
     drillings.
Industries:
     fishing, oil and gas production
 
                              Communications
 
Ports:
     Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong, Los Angeles (US), Manila (Philippines),
     Pusan (South Korea), San Francisco (US), Seattle (US), Shanghai
     (China), Singapore, Sydney (Australia), Vladivostok (Russia),
     Wellington (NZ), Yokohama (Japan)
 
 
Telecommunications:
     several submarine cables with network nodal points on Guam and Hawaii
