     July 1974, which gave the Turkish Cypriots de facto control in the
     north; Greek Cypriots control the only internationally recognized
     government; on 15 November 1983 Turkish Cypriot President Rauf
     DENKTASH declared independence and the formation of a "Turkish
     Republic of Northern Cyprus" (TRNC), which has been recognized only by
     Turkey; both sides publicly call for the resolution of intercommunal

                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and prosperous.
     Industry contributes 16% to GDP and employs 29% of the labor force,
     while the service sector contributes 60% to GDP and employs 57% of the
     labor force. An average 6.8% rise in real GDP between 1986 and 1990
     was temporarily checked in 1991, because of the adverse effects of the
     Gulf War on tourism. Economic growth surged again in 1992, bolstered
     by strong foreign and domestic demand. As the economy gained momentum,
     however, it began to overheat; inflation reached 6.5%. The economy has
     likely recorded a sharp drop in growth in 1993, due to the recession
     in Western Europe, Cyprus' main trading partner, but probably will
     pick up again in 1994. The Turkish Cypriot economy has less than
     one-third the per capita GDP in the south. Because it is recognized
     only by Turkey, it has had much difficulty arranging foreign
     financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to invest there. The
     economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture, which employs more
     than one-quarter of the workforce. Moreover, because the Turkish lira
     is legal tender, the Turkish Cypriot economy has suffered the same
     high inflation as mainland Turkey. To compensate for the economy's
     weakness, Turkey provides direct and indirect aid to nearly every
     sector; financial support has reached about one-third of Turkish
     Cypriot GDP.
