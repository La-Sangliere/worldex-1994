                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest, most densely populated, and
     least developed nations. Its economy is overwhelmingly agricultural,
     with the cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the
     economy. Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and
     floods, government interference with the economy, a rapidly growing
     labor force that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, a low level of
     industrialization, failure to fully exploit energy resources (natural
     gas), and inefficient and inadequate power supplies. Excellent rice
     crops and expansion of the export garment industry helped growth in
     FY92 and FY93. Policy reforms intended to reduce government regulation
     of private industry and promote public-sector efficiency have been
     announced but are being implemented only slowly.
