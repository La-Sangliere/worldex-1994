                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy is based on sugar, bauxite, and tourism. In September
     1988, Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on crops and the
     electric power system, a sharp but temporary setback to the economy.
     By October 1989 the economic recovery from the hurricane was largely
     complete, and real growth was up to about 3% for 1989. In 1991,
     however, growth dropped to 0.2% as a result of the US recession, lower
     world bauxite prices, and monetary instability. In 1992, growth was
     1.2%, supported by a recovery in tourism and stabilization of the
     Jamaican dollar in the second half of 1992.
