                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Colombia's economic growth has recovered steadily since 1991 as
     President GAVIRIA'S sweeping economic reform measures have taken hold.
     Market reforms have included trade and investment liberalization,
     labor and tax overhauls and bureaucratic streamlining, among other
     things. Furthermore, conservative fiscal and monetary policies have
     helped to steadily reduce inflation to 23% and unemployment to about
     7% in 1993. The rapid development of oil, coal, and other
     nontraditional industries has helped offset the decline in coffee
     prices. A major oil find in 1993 in eastern Colombia may provide an
     extra $3 billion annually to the economy by 1997. Increased foreign
     investment and even greater domestic activity have been hampered,
     however, by a troublesome rural insurgency, a decrepit energy and
     transportation infrastructure, and drug-related violence. Agriculture
     also has encountered problems in adjusting to fewer subsidies, greater
     competition, and the collapse of the international coffee agreement,
     which has kept world coffee prices at near-record lows in 1991-93.
     Business construction was a leading sector in 1993. The substantial
     trade deficit in 1993 was the result of a strong peso that inhibited
     exports and a liberalized government policy that spurred imports.
