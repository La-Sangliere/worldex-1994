     grassland in east
Terrain:
     mostly flat-to-rolling sandy desert with dunes; broad, flat intensely
     irrigated river valleys along course of Amu Darya and Sirdaryo Rivers;
     Fergana Valley in east surrounded by mountainous Tajikistan and

Environment:
current issues:
     drying up of the Aral Sea is resulting in growing concentrations of
     chemical pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then blown
     from the increasingly exposed lake bed and contribute to
     desertification; water pollution from industrial wastes is the cause
     of many human health disorders; increasing soil salinization; soil
     contamination from agricultural chemicals, including DDT
natural hazards:
     NA

                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which 20% is intensely
     cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It is one of the poorest states
     of the former USSR with 60% of its population living in overpopulated
     rural communities. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan is the world's third
     largest cotton exporter, a major producer of gold and natural gas, and
     a regionally significant producer of chemicals and machinery. Since
     independence, the government has sought to prop up the Soviet-style
     command economy with subsidies and tight controls on prices and
     production. Such policies have buffered the economy from the sharp
     declines in output and high inflation experienced by many other former
     Soviet republics. By late 1993, however, they had become increasingly
     unsustainable as inflation soared and Russia forced the Uzbek
     Government to introduce its own currency. Faced with mounting economic
     problems, the government has increased its cooperation with
     international financial institutions, announced an acceleration of
     privatization, and stepped up efforts to attract foreign investors.
     Nevertheless, the regime is likely to resist full-fledged market
     reforms.
