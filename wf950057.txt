                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of several
     islands that have poor transportation links, a young and rapidly
     increasing population, and few natural resources. The low educational
     level of the labor force contributes to a low level of economic
     activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants
     and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and
     forestry, is the leading sector of the economy. It contributes 40% to
     GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.
     The country is not self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the
     main staple, accounts for 90% of imports. During 1982-86 the
     industrial sector grew at an annual average rate of 5.3%, but its
     contribution to GDP is small. Despite major investment in the tourist
     industry, which accounts for about 25% of GDP, growth has stagnated
     since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of 1.5% during 1985-90 has led to
     large budget deficits, declining incomes, and balance-of-payments
     difficulties. Estimates for 1992 show a moderate increase in the
     growth rate based on increased exports, tourism, and government
     investment outlays.
