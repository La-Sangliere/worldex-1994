                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base,
     a serious, long-term drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is
     service oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services
     accounting for 60% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives
     in rural areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 20%; the fishing
     sector accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The
     fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. In
     1988 fishing represented only 3.5% of GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a
     high trade deficit, financed by remittances from emigrants and foreign
     aid. Economic reforms launched by the new democratic government in
     February 1991 are aimed at developing the private sector and
     attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.
