                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Since World War II the Italian economy has changed from one based on
     agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the
     same total and per capita output as France and the UK. The country is
     still divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private
     companies, and an undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large
     public enterprises. Services account for 48% of GDP, industry 35%,
     agriculture 4%, and public administration 13%. Most raw materials
     needed by industry and over 75% of energy requirements must be
     imported. After growing at an annual average rate of 3% in 1983-90,
     growth slowed to about 1% in 1991 and 1992 and fell by 0.7% in 1993.
     In the second half of 1992, Rome became unsettled by the prospect of
     not qualifying to participate in EC plans for economic and monetary
     union later in the decade; thus it finally began to address its huge
     fiscal imbalances. Thanks to the determination of Prime Ministers
     AMATO and CIAMPI, the government adopted a fairly stringent budget for
     1993 and 1994, abandoned its highly inflationary wage indexation
     system, and started to scale back its extremely generous social
     welfare programs, including pension and health care benefits. Monetary
     officials were forced to withdraw the lira from the European monetary
     system in September 1992 when it came under extreme pressure in
     currency markets. For the 1990s, Italy faces the problems of
     refurbishing a tottering communications system, curbing pollution in
     major industrial centers, and adjusting to the new competitive forces
     accompanying the ongoing economic integration of the European Union.
