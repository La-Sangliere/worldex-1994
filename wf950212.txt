Note:
     Serbia and Montenegro have asserted the formation of a joint
     independent state, but this entity has not been formally recognized as
     a state by the US; the US view is that the Socialist Federal Republic
     of Yugoslavia (SFRY) has dissolved and that none of the successor
     republics represents its continuation

Overview:
     The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation has been followed by
     bloody ethnic warfare, the destabilization of republic boundaries, and
     the breakup of important interrepublic trade flows. Serbia and
     Montenegro faces major economic problems; output has dropped sharply,
     particularly in 1993. First, like the other former Yugoslav republics,
     it depended on its sister republics for large amounts of foodstuffs,
     energy supplies, and manufactures. Wide varieties in climate, mineral
     resources, and levels of technology among the republics accentuate
     this interdependence, as did the communist practice of concentrating
     much industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The breakup
     of many of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial
     plants lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical
     assets in the fighting all have contributed to the economic
     difficulties of the republics. One singular factor in the economic
     situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a
     communist government that is primarily interested in political and
     military mastery, not economic reform. A further complication is the
     imposition of economic sanctions by the UN.

     tobacco, and a small amount of cereals; the mountainous pastures of
