                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Rapid growth of free trade zones has led to a substantial expansion of
     manufacturing for export, especially of wearing apparel. Over the past
     decade, tourism has also increased in importance and is a major earner
     of foreign exchange and a source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a
     key sector of the economy. The principal commercial crop is sugarcane,
     followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa, and tobacco. Domestic industry is
     based on the processing of agricultural products, oil refining,
     minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is officially reported at about
     30%, but there is considerable underemployment. Growth fell to a
     moderate 3% in 1993 because of power shortages in industry and
     political uncertainty which slowed down foreign investment.
