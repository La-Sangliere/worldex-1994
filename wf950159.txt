                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Mexico's economy, made up predominantly of private manufacturing and
     services and both large-scale and traditional agriculture, is
     beginning to rebound from the economic difficulties of the 1980s but
     still faces key challenges. During the 1980s, the accumulation of
     large external debts, falling world petroleum prices, rapid population
     growth, and mounting inflation and unemployment plagued the economy.
     In recent years, the government has responded by implementing sweeping
     economic reforms. Strict fiscal and monetary discipline have brought
     inflation under control, reduced the internal debt, and produced
     budgetary surpluses in 1992 and 1993. The tight money policies,
     however, have restricted growth: barely 0.4% in 1993 after a rise of
     2.6% in 1992 and 3.6% in 1991. Another aspect of the reform has been
     the privatization of more than 80% of Mexico's businesses, including
     all of the commercial banks. Seeking out increased trade and
     investment opportunities, the government negotiated the North American
     Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada, which
     entered into force on 1 January 1994. Within Latin America, Mexico has
     completed bilateral free trade agreements with Chile and Costa Rica,
     and is continuing negotiations with Colombia and Venezuela for a
     trilateral deal in addition to holding trade discussions with various
     other nations. In January of 1993, Mexico replaced its old peso at the
     rate of 1,000 old to 1 new peso. Despite its hard-won economic
     progress and the prospects of long-term gains under NAFTA, Mexico
     still faces difficult problems, including sluggish growth,
     unemployment, continuing social inequalities, serious pollution, and
     the prospect of increased competition with the opening of trade.
