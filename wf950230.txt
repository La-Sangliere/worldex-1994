                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Switzerland's economy - one of the most prosperous and stable in the
     world - is nonetheless undergoing a painful adjustment after both the
     inflationary boom of the late-1980s and the electorate's rejection of
     membership in the European Economic Area in 1992. The Swiss finally
     emerged from a three-year recession in mid-1993 and posted a -0.6% GDP
     growth for the year. After a three-year struggle with inflation, the
     Swiss central bank's tight monetary policies have begun to pay off.
     Inflation slowed to 3.3% in 1993 from about 4% in 1992 and is expected
     to slow down further to 1.5% in 1994. Unemployment, however, will
     continue to be a problem over the near term. Swiss unemployment
     reached 5.1% in 1993 and will likely remain at that level through 1994
     before declining in 1995. The voters' rejection of a referendum on
     membership in the EEA, which was supported by most political,
     business, and financial leaders has raised doubts that the country can
     maintain its preeminent prosperity and leadership in commercial
     banking in the twenty-first century. Despite these problems, Swiss per
     capita output, general living standards, education and science, health
     care, and diet remain unsurpassed in Europe. The country has few
     natural resources except for the scenic natural beauty that has made
     it a world leader in tourism. Management-labor relations remain
     generally harmonious.
