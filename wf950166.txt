                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Morocco faces the typical problems of developing
     countries--restraining government spending, reducing constraints on
     private activity and foreign trade, and keeping inflation within
     bounds. Since the early 1980s the government has pursued an economic
     program toward these objectives with the support of the IMF, the World
     Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The economy has substantial
     assets to draw on: the world's largest phosphate reserves, diverse
     agricultural and fishing resources, a sizable tourist industry, a
     growing manufacturing sector, and large remittances from Moroccans
     working abroad. However, a severe drought in 1992-93 has depressed
     economic activity and held down experts. Real GDP contracted by 2.9%
     in 1992, and growth for 1993 is estimated at only 2%. Despite these
     setbacks, initiatives to relax capital controls, strengthen the
     banking sector, and privatize state enterprises went forward in 1993.
     Servicing the large debt, high unemployment, and vulnerability to
     external economic forces remain long-term problems for Morocco.
