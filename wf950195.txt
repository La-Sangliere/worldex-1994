Overview:
     Poland is continuing the difficult transition to a market economy that
     began on 1 January 1990, when the new democratic government instituted
     "shock therapy" by decontrolling prices, slashing subsidies, and
     drastically reducing import barriers. The economy contracted sharply
     in 1990 and 1991, but in 1992 real GDP grew 1% despite a severe
     drought. Real GDP expanded about 4% in 1993, the highest rate in
     Europe except for Albania. About half of GDP now comes from the
     private sector even though privatization of the large state-owned
     enterprises is proceeding slowly and most industry remains in state
     hands. The pattern of industrial production is changing rapidly;
     output of textiles and construction materials is well above 1990
     levels, while output of basic metals remains depressed. Inflation,
     which had exceeded 50% monthly in late 1989, was down to about 37% for
     all of 1993, as the government held the budget deficit below 3% of
     GDP. Unemployment has risen steadily, however, to about 16%. The trade
     deficit is also a problem, in part due to recession in Western Europe,
     Poland's main customer. The new government elected in September 1993
     is politically to the left of its predecessor but is continuing the
     reform process.
