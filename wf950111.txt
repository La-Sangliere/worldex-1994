                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Hungary is still in the midst of a difficult transition from a command
     to a market economy. Its economic reforms during the Communist era
     gave it a head start on this process, particularly in terms of
     attracting foreign investors - Hungary has accounted for about half of
     all foreign direct investment in Eastern Europe since 1989.
     Nonetheless, the economy continued to contract in 1993, with real GDP
     falling perhaps 1%. Although the privatization process has lagged, in
     December 1993 Hungary carried out the largest privatization yet in
     Eastern Europe, selling a controlling interest in the Matav
     telecommunications firm to private investors - including a 30% share
     to a US-German consortium for $875 million. Overall, about half of GDP
     now originates in the private sector. Unemployment rose to about 13%
     in 1993 while inflation remained above 20%, and falling exports pushed
     the trade deficit to about $3 billion. The government hopes that
     economic recovery in Western Europe in 1994 will boost exports, lower
     the trade deficit, and help jump-start the economy. The budget,
     however, is likely to remain a serious concern; depressed tax revenue
     pushed up the budget deficit in 1993.
