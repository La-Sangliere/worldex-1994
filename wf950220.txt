                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Many of the white one-seventh of the South African population enjoy
     incomes, material comforts, and health and educational standards equal
     to those of Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining
     population suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third World,
     including unemployment and lack of job skills. The main strength of
     the economy lies in its rich mineral resources, which provide
     two-thirds of exports. Economic developments for the remainder of the
     1990s will be driven largely by the new government's attempts to
     improve black living conditions and to set the country on an
     aggressive export-led growth path. The shrinking economy in recent
     years has absorbed less than 5% of the more than 300,000 workers
     entering the labor force annually. Local economists estimate that the
     economy must grow between 5% and 6% in real terms annually to absorb
     all of the new entrants.
