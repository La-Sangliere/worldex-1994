                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The country has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
     deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and
     fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has
     fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP declined about 8% in 1987,
     as the fish catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986
     and copra production was hampered by repeated rains. Output rebounded
     strongly in 1988, with real GDP growing by 17%. The upturn in economic
     growth came from an increase in copra production and a good fish
     catch. Following the strong surge in output in 1988, GNP increased 1%
     in both 1989 and 1990.
