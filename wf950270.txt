Appendix C:  International Organizations and Groups
-----
Note: The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) has dissolved,
and ceases to exist. None of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia,
including Serbia and Montenegro, have been permitted to participate solely
on the basis of the membership of the former Yugoslavia in the United
Nations General Assembly and Economic and Social Council and their
subsidiary bodies and in various United Nations Specialized Agencies. The
United Nations, however, permits the seat and nameplate of the SFRY to
remain, permits the SFRY mission to continue to function, and continues to
fly the flag of the former Yugoslavia. For a variety of reasons, a number
of other organizations have not yet taken action with regard to the
membership of the former Yugoslavia. The World Factbook therefore continues
to list Yugoslavia under international organizations where the SFRY seat
remains or where no action has yet been taken.
