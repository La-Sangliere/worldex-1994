                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts,
     an industrial sector based largely on oil, support services, and a
     government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. A reform
     program, supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in
     1990-91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political
     regime and a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry
     as the mainstay of the economy, providing about two-thirds of
     government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil
     revenues enabled Congo to finance large-scale development projects
     with growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa.
     Subsequently, growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1.5%
     annually, only half the population growth rate. Political turmoil and
     misguided government investment have derailed economic reform programs
     sponsored by the IMF and World Bank.
