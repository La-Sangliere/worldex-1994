                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Burma has a mixed economy with about 70% private activity, mainly in
     agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with about 30%
     state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy industry, and
     foreign trade. Government policy in the last five years, 1989-93, has
     aimed at revitalizing the economy after four decades of tight central
     planning. Thus, private activity has markedly increased; foreign
     investment has been encouraged, so far with moderate success; and
     efforts continue to increase the efficiency of state enterprises.
     Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly understated
     because of the volume of black market trade. A major ongoing problem
     is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal stability. Inflation has
     been running at 25% to 30% annually. Good weather helped boost GDP by
     perhaps 5% in 1993. Although Burma remains a poor Asian country, its
     rich resources furnish the potential for substantial long-term
     increases in income, exports, and living standards.
