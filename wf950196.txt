                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Portugal's economy registered only 1.1% growth in 1992 and contracted
     by 0.4% in 1993, in contrast to the 4.5% average of the fast-paced
     1986-90 period. Recession in the European Union, which accounts for
     75% of Portugal's international trade, is the key factor in the
     downturn. The government's long-run economic goal is the modernization
     of Portuguese markets, industry, infrastructure, and workforce in
     order to catch up with productivity and income levels of the more
     advanced EU countries. Per capita income now equals only 55% of the EU
     average. The government's medium-term economic objective is to be in
     the first tier of EU countries eligible to join the economic and
     monetary union (EMU) as early as 1997. Economic policy in 1993 focused
     on reducing inflationary pressures by lowering the fiscal deficit,
     maintaining a stable escudo, moderating wage increases, and
     encouraging increased competition. Resumption of growth in the short
     run depends on the revival of growth in Europe as a whole, not a
     likely prospect in the immediate future.
