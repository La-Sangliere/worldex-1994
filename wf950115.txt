                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Indonesia is a mixed economy with some socialist institutions and
     central planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and
     private enterprise. Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with
     a large and rapidly increasing population, it remains a poor country.
     Real GDP growth in 1985-93 averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but
     not sufficient to both slash underemployment and absorb the 2.3
     million workers annually entering the labor force. Agriculture,
     including forestry and fishing, is an important sector, accounting for
     21% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force. The staple crop is rice.
     Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia is now nearly
     self-sufficient. Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and textiles
     and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job generation.
     Industrial output now accounts for almost 40% of GDP and is based on a
     supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas,
     timber, metals, and coal. Foreign investment has also boosted
     manufacturing output and exports in recent years. Indeed, the
     economy's growth is highly dependent on the continuing expansion of
     nonoil exports. Japan remains Indonesia's most important customer and
     supplier of aid. Rapid growth in the money supply in 1989-90 prompted
     Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy in 1991, forcing the
     private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing. Real
     interest rates remained above 10% and off-shore commercial debt grew.
     The growth in off-shore debt prompted Jakarta to limit foreign
     borrowing beginning in late 1991. Despite the continued problems in
     moving toward a more open financial system and the persistence of a
     fairly tight credit situation, GDP growth in 1992 and 1993 has matched
     the government target of 6%-7% annual growth.
