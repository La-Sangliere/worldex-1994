                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world.
     Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for
     over 90% of the population and accounting for 60% of GDP. Industrial
     activity is limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural
     produce (jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles
     and carpets has expanded recently and accounted for 85% of foreign
     exchange earnings in FY94. Apart from agricultural land and forests,
     exploitable natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism.
     Agricultural production in the late 1980s grew by about 5%, as
     compared with annual population growth of 2.6%. More than 40% of the
     population is undernourished. Since May 1991, the government has been
     encouraging trade and foreign investment, e.g., by eliminating
     business licenses and registration requirements in order to simplify
     domestic and foreign investment. The government also has been cutting
     public expenditures by reducing subsidies, privatizing state
     industries, and laying off civil servants. Prospects for foreign trade
     and investment in the 1990s remain poor, however, because of the small
     size of the economy, its technological backwardness, its remoteness,
     and susceptibility to natural disaster. Nepal experienced severe
     flooding in August 1993 which caused at least $50 million in damage to
     the country's infrastructure.
