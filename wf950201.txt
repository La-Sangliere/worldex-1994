Overview:
     Russia, a vast country with a wealth of natural resources, a
     well-educated population, and a diverse industrial base, continues to
     experience severe difficulties in moving from its old centrally
     planned economy to a modern market economy. President YEL'TSIN's
     government has made some progress toward a market economy by freeing
     most prices, slashing defense spending, unifying foreign exchange
     rates, and launching an ambitious privatization program. Yet much of
     the old order persists and YEL'TSIN faces formidable opposition to
     further measures such as the reduction of subsidies to old-line
     industries. Output continues to fall although the mix is gradually
     becoming more responsive to Russia's needs. According to Russian
     official data, GDP declined by 12% in 1993 compared with 19% in 1992.
     Industrial output in 1993 fell 16% with all major sectors taking a
     hit. Agricultural production, meanwhile, was down 6%. The grain
     harvest totalled 99 million tons - some 8 million tons less than in
     1992. Unemployment climbed in 1993 but remained low by Western
     standards. The official number of unemployed rose from 578,000 at the
     beginning of 1993 to about 1 million - or roughly 1.4% of the work
     force - by yearend. According to the Russian labor minister, the
     actual number of unemployed probably was closer to 4 million.
     Government fears of large-scale unemployment continued to hamper
     industrial restructuring efforts. According to official statistics,
     average real wages remained flat. Nonetheless, a substantial portion
     of the population, particularly the elderly and people in remote
     areas, finds its well-being steadily shrinking. The disparity in
     incomes between the rich and poor continued to rise in 1993, primarily
     reflecting the high earnings of enterprise managers and persons
     employed in the emerging private sector. The government tried to
     narrow the income gap by raising the wages of budget-funded workers -
     mainly teachers and health care specialists. Official data may
     overstate hardships, because many Russians supplement their income by
     moonlighting or by bartering goods and services, activities that often
     go unreported. Russia made good progress on privatization in 1993
     despite active opposition from key cabinet members, hard-line
     legislators, and antireform regional leaders. By yearend, for example,
     roughly 35% of Russia's medium and large state enterprises had been
     auctioned, while the number of private farms in Russia increased by
     86,000, reaching a total of 170,000. As a result, about 6% of
     agricultural land now has been privatized. Financial stabilization
     continued to remain a challenge for the government. Moscow tightened
     financial policies in early 1993 - including postponing planned budget
     spending - and succeeded in reducing monthly inflation from 27% in
     January to 20% in May and June. In the summer, however, the government
     relaxed austerity measures in the face of mounting pressure from
     industry and agriculture, sparking a new round of inflation; the
     monthly inflation rate jumped to 25% in August. In response, Moscow
     announced a package of measures designed to curb government spending
     and inflation. It included eliminating bread subsidies, delaying
     payment obligations, raising interest rates, and phasing out
     concessionary Central Bank credits to enterprises and regions. The
     measures met with some success; the monthly inflation rate declined to
     13% in December. According to official statistics, Russia's 1993 trade
     with nations outside the former Soviet Union produced a $16 billion
     surplus, up from $6 billion in 1992. Moscow arrested the steep drop in
 
 
     exports that it had been suffering as a result of ruptured ties with
     former trading partners, output declines, and erratic efforts to move
     to world prices. Foreign sales - comprised largely of oil, natural
     gas, and other raw materials - grew slightly. Imports were down by 15%
     or so as a result of new import taxes and Moscow's reluctance to
     increase its debt burden by purchasing grain and other goods with
     foreign credits. Russian trade with other former Soviet republics
     continued to decline and yielded a surplus of some $5 billion. At the
     same time, Russia paid only a fraction of the roughly $20 billion in
     debt coming due in 1993, and by mid-year, Russia's foreign debt had
     amounted to $81.5 billion. While Moscow reached agreement to
     restructure debts with Paris Club official creditors in April 1993,
     Moscow's refusal to waive its right to sovereign immunity kept Russia
     and its bank creditors from agreeing to restructure Moscow's
     commercial loans. Capital flight continued to be a serious problem in
     1993, with billions of dollars in assets owned by Russians being
     parked abroad at yearend. Russia's capital stock continues to
     deteriorate because of insufficient maintenance and new construction.
     The capital stock on average is twice the age of capital stock in the
     West. Many years will pass before Russia can take full advantage of
     its natural resources and its human assets.

Telecommunications:
     Russia is enlisting foreign help, by means of joint ventures, to speed
     up the modernization of its telecommunications system; NMT-450 analog
     cellular telephone networks are operational and growing in Moscow and
     St. Petersburg; expanded access to international E-mail service
     available via Sprint network; intercity fiberoptic cable installation
     remains limited; the inadequacy of Russian telecommunications is a
     severe handicap to the economy, especially with respect to
     international connections; total installed telephones 24,400,000, of
     which in urban areas 20,900,000 and in rural areas 3,500,000; of
     these, total installed in homes 15,400,000; total pay phones for long
     distant calls 34,100; telephone density is about 164 telephones per
     1,000 persons (in 1992, only 661,000 new telephones were installed
     compared with 855,000 in 1991 and in 1992 the number of unsatisfied
     applications for telephones reached 11,000,000); international traffic
     is handled by an inadequate system of satellites, land lines,
     microwave radio relay and outdated submarine cables; this traffic
     passes through the international gateway switch in Moscow which
     carries most of the international traffic for the other countries of
     the Commonwealth of Independent States; a new Russian Raduga satellite
     will link Moscow and St. Petersburg with Rome from whence calls will
     be relayed to destinations in Europe and overseas; satellite ground
     stations - INTELSAT, Intersputnik, Eutelsat (Moscow), INMARSAT,
     Orbita; broadcast stations - 1,050 AM/FM/SW (reach 98.6% of
     population), 7,183 TV; receiving sets - 54,200,000 TVs, 48,800,000
     radio receivers, 74,300,000 radio receivers with multiple speaker
     systems for program diffusion
