Note:
     The war between Israel and Egypt, Syria, and Jordan in June 1967 ended
     with Israel in control of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza
     Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. Israel withdrew
     from the Sinai Peninsula pursuant to a 1979 peace treaty with Egypt.
     The Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
     Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13 September 1993,
     provides for a transitional period not exceeding five years of
     Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West
     Bank. Under the DOP, final status negotiations are to begin no later
     than the beginning of the third year of the transitional period.

Note:
     Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
     Self-Government Arragements ("the DOP"), Israel agreed to transfer
     certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, and
     subsequently to an elected Palestinian Council, as part of interim
     self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A
     transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho
     has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement
     on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area. The DOP provides that Israel
     will retain responsibility during the transitional period for external
     security and for internal security and public order of settlements and
     Israelis. Final status is to be determined through direct negotiations
     within five years.

Overview:
     In 1991 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the
     border by Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural
     enterprises, with worker remittances accounting for about one-third of
     GNP. The construction, agricultural, and industrial sectors account
     for about 18%, 16%, and 12% of GNP, respectively. Gaza depends upon
     Israel for nearly 90% of its external trade. Aggravating the impact of
     Israeli military administration, unrest in the territory since 1988
     (intifadah) has raised unemployment and lowered the standard of living
     of Gazans. The Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt
     blows to Gaza since August 1990. Worker remittances from the Gulf
     states have dropped, unemployment has increased, and exports have
     fallen. The withdrawal of Israel from the Gaza Strip in May 1994
     brings a new set of adjustment problems.
