                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The prosperous economy is based primarily on small-scale light
     industry and tourism. Industry accounts for 53% of total employment,
     the service sector 45% (mostly based on tourism), and agriculture and
     forestry 2%. The sale of postage stamps to collectors is estimated at
     $10 million annually. Low business taxes (the maximum tax rate is 20%)
     and easy incorporation rules have induced about 25,000 holding or
     so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in
     Liechtenstein. Such companies, incorporated solely for tax purposes,
     provide 30% of state revenues. The economy is tied closely to
     Switzerland's economy in a customs union, and incomes and living
     standards parallel those of the more prosperous Swiss groups.
