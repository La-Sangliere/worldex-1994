Overview:
     Subsistence agriculture, including forestry, remains the backbone of
     the CAR economy, with more than 70% of the population living in the

     GDP. Timber accounted for about 26% of export earnings and the diamond
     industry for 54%. Important constraints to economic development
     include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system,
     and a weak human resource base. Multilateral and bilateral development
     assistance, particularly from France, plays a major role in providing
     capital for new investment.
