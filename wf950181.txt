                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance from the
     US. The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government
     revenues have grown. An agreement for the years 1986 to 1992 entitled
     the islands to $228 million for capital development, government
     operations, and special programs. A rapidly growing major source of
     income is the tourist industry, which now employs about 50% of the
     work force. Japanese tourists predominate. The agricultural sector is
     made up of cattle ranches and small farms producing coconuts,
     breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. Industry is small scale, mostly
     handicrafts and light manufacturing.
