Note:
     The territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included
     in the data below. In keeping with the framework established at the
     Madrid Conference in October 1991, bilateral negotiations are being
     conducted between Israel and Palestinian representatives, Syria, and
     Jordan to determine the final status of the occupied territories. On
     25 April 1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979
     Israel-Egypt Peace treaty.

                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Israel has a market economy with substantial government participation.
     It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and
     military equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has
     intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the
     past 20 years. Industry employs about 22% of Israeli workers,
     construction 6.5%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 3.5%, and
     services most of the rest. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and
     agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports.
     Israel usually posts current account deficits, which are covered by
     large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half
     of the government's external debt is owed to the United States, which
     is its major source of economic and military aid. To earn needed
     foreign exchange, Israel has been targeting high-technology niches in
     international markets, such as medical scanning equipment. The influx
     of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR, which topped 450,000 during
     the period 1990-93, increased unemployment, intensified housing
     problems, and strained the government budget. At the same time, the
     immigrants bring to the economy valuable scientific and professional
     expertise. Economic problems have eased as immigration has declined,
     but activity has slowed as the economy shifts from housing to
     export-driven growth.
