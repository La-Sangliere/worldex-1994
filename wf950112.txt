                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic, but
     with an extensive welfare system, relatively low unemployment, and
     comparatively even distribution of income. The economy is heavily
     dependent on the fishing industry, which provides nearly 75% of export
     earnings and employs 12% of the workforce. In the absence of other
     natural resources - except energy - Iceland's economy is vulnerable to
     changing world fish prices. Iceland's economy has been in recession
     since 1988. The recession continued in 1993 due to a third year of
     cutbacks in fishing quotas as well as falling world prices for the
     country's main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and
     ferrosilicon. Real GDP declined 3.3% in 1992 and rose slightly, by
     0.4%, in 1993. The center-right government's economic goals include
     reducing the budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign
     borrowing, containing inflation, revising agricultural and fishing
     policies, diversifying the economy, and privatizing state-owned
     industries. The recession has led to a wave of bankruptcies and
     mergers throughout the economy, as well as the highest unemployment of
     the post-World War II period. Inflation, previously a serious problem,
     declined from double digit rates in the 1980s to only 3.7% in 1992-93.
