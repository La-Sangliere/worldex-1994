                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     More than 90% of this command economy is socialized; agricultural land
     is collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of
     manufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is unusually
     tight even for a Communist country because of the small size and
     homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM Il-song and his
     son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during the period 1984-88 averaged
     2%-3%, but output declined by 3%-5% annually during 1989-92 because of
     systemic problems and disruptions in socialist-style economic
     relations with the former USSR and China. In 1992, output dropped
     sharply, by perhaps 7%-9%, as the economy felt the cumulative effect
     of the reduction in outside support. The leadership insisted on
     maintaining its high level of military outlays from a shrinking
     economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown in inventories and critical
     shortages in the energy sector have led to increasing interruptions in
     industrial production. Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have
     formed the basis of industrial development since WWII. Output of the
     extractive industries includes coal, iron ore, magnesite, graphite,
     copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals. Manufacturing is centered on
     heavy industry, including military industry, with light industry
     lagging far behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties,
     expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea
     has not yet become self-sufficient in food production. Six consecutive
     years of poor harvests, coupled with distribution problems, have led
     to chronic food shortages. North Korea remains far behind South Korea
     in economic development and living standards.
