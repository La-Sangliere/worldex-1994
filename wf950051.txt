                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Chile has a prosperous, essentially free market economy, with the
     degree of government intervention varying according to the philosophy
     of the different regimes. Under the center-left government of
     President AYLWIN, which took power in March 1990, spending on social
     welfare has risen steadily. At the same time business investment,
     exports and consumer spending have also grown substantially. The new
     president, FREI, who takes office in March 1994, is expected to
     emphasize social spending even more. Growth in 1991-93 has averaged 8%
     annually, with an estimated one million Chileans having moved out of
     poverty in the last four years. Copper remains vital to the health of
     the economy; Chile is the world's largest producer and exporter of
     copper.
