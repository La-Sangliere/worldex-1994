                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of which are
     expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have given
     Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World -
     $10,000 annually. Few other resources exist, so most necessities must
     be imported, including fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation
     of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are
     serious long-term problems. Substantial amounts of phosphate income
     are invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition.
