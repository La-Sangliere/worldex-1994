                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The economy is
     heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 58% of GDP,
     provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry
     accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing
     agricultural products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery
     program announced in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in
     agricultural production and financial support for the program by
     bilateral donors. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and
     bilateral donors have provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's
     deteriorated economic infrastructure. Growth in 1991-93 featured a
     pickup in industrial production and a substantial increase in output
     of minerals led by gold.
