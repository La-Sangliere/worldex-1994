                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry, which accounts for
     15% of GDP and about 70% of export earnings. The economy has been in
     trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in 1982. A drop in world
     bauxite prices which started in the late 1970s and continued until
     late 1986 was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in
     the interior that crippled the important bauxite sector. Although the
     insurgency has since ebbed and the bauxite sector recovered,
     Paramaribo has failed to initiate the economic reforms necessary to
     stabilize the economy or win renewed Dutch aid disbursements. High
     inflation, high unemployment, widespread black market activity, and
     hard currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy.
