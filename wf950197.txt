                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean
     region. Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary sector of
     economic activity and income. Encouraged by duty free access to the US
     and by tax incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico
     since the 1950s. US minimum wage laws apply. Important industries
     include pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles, petrochemicals, and
     processed foods. Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and
     other livestock products as the main source of income in the
     agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important
     source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals of nearly 3
     million tourists in 1989. Unemployment remains a severe problem at
     18%.
