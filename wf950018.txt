                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Austria boasts a prosperous and stable socialist market economy with a
     sizable but falling proportion of nationalized industry and extensive
     welfare benefits. Thanks to its raw material endowment, a technically
     skilled labor force, and strong links to German industrial firms,
     Austria occupies specialized niches in European industry and services
     (tourism, banking) and produces almost enough food to feed itself with
     only 8% of the labor force in agriculture. Increased export sales
     resulting from German unification, boosted Austria's economy through
     1991, but Austria's GDP growth slowed to 2% in 1992 and -0.5% in 1993
     due to the weak international economy, particularly in Germany - its
     largest trading partner. GDP growth will resume slowly in 1994, with
     estimates ranging from a 0.5% to a 1% increase. Unemployment has risen
     to 7% as a result of the slowdown and will continue to rise in 1994.
     Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level of
     subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary
     capabilities. Austria's government has taken measures to make the
     economy more liberal and open by introducing a major tax reform,
     privatizing state-owned firms, and liberalizing cross-border capital
     movements. Although it will face increased competition, Austria should
     benefit from the continued opening of eastern European markets, as
     well as the 1 January 1994 start of the European Economic Area which
     extends the European Union rules on the free movement of people,
     capital, and goods and services to four members (including Austria) of
     the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Austria has concluded
     membership negotiations with the European Union and is expected to
     join in early 1995, thus broadening European economic unity. The
     government, however, plans to hold a national referendum on the matter
     on 12 June 1994; support for and opposition to membership appears
     about equal.
