                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     The economy is small and trade dependent. Agriculture, once the most
     important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 37%
     of GDP, about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor force.
     Since 1987, real GDP growth, led by exports, has averaged 4% annually.
     Over the same period, inflation has fallen sharply and chronic trade
     deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses. Unemployment
     remains a serious problem, however, and job creation is the main focus
     of government policy. To ease unemployment, Dublin aggressively courts
     foreign investors and recently created a new industrial development
     agency to aid small indigenous firms. Government assistance is
     constrained by Dublin's continuing deficit reduction measures.
