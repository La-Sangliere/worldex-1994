                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy depends mainly on US military spending and on revenues
     from tourism. Over the past 20 years the tourist industry has grown
     rapidly, creating a construction boom for new hotels and the expansion
     of older ones. Visitors numbered about 900,000 in 1992. The slowdown
     in Japanese economic growth has been reflected in less vigorous growth
     in the tourism sector. About 60% of the labor force works for the
     private sector and the rest for government. Most food and industrial
     goods are imported, with about 75% from the US. In early 1994, Guam
     faces the problem of building up the civilian economic sector to
     offset the impact of military downsizing.
