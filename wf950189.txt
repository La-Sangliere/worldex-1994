                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but
     exploitation has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost
     of developing an infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence
     livelihood for 85% of the population. Mining of numerous deposits,
     including copper and gold, accounts for about 60% of export earnings.
     Budgetary support from Australia and development aid under World Bank
     auspices have helped sustain the economy. Robust growth in 1991-92 was
     led by the mining sector; the opening of a large new gold mine helped
     the advance. The economy remained strong in 1993, primarily because of
     continued growth in the mining and oil sectors.
