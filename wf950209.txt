                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country gained
     independence nearly 15 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa
     production has gradually deteriorated because of drought and
     mismanagement, so that by 1987 output had fallen to less than 50% of
     its former levels. As a result, a shortage of cocoa for export has
     created a serious balance-of-payments problem. Production of less
     important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm kernels, has also
     declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of exports by a
     ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense of other
     food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food needs. It
     also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods. Over the
     years, Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt, which
     amounts to roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable potential
     exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government has
     taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government also
     implemented a Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to restructure the
     economy and reschedule external debt service payments in cooperation
     with the International Development Association and Western lenders.
