                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming, modern
     agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a
     multitude of support services. Faster economic growth in the 1980s
     permitted a significant increase in real per capita private
     consumption. A large share of the population, perhaps as much as 40%,
     remains too poor to afford an adequate diet. Financial strains in 1990
     and 1991 prompted government austerity measures that slowed industrial
     growth but permitted India to meet its international payment
     obligations without rescheduling its debt. Policy reforms since 1991
     have extended earlier economic liberalization and greatly reduced
     government controls on production, trade, and investment. US and other
     foreign firms are increasing their investment in India. In January
     1994, international financial reserves were comfortably high.
