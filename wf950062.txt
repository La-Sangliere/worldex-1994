                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers and exporters of
     coffee, cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently, the economy is
     highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee
     and cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the
     government to diversify, the economy is still largely dependent on
     agriculture and related industries. The agricultural sector accounts
     for over one-third of GDP and about 80% of export earnings and employs
     about 85% of the labor force. A collapse of world cocoa and coffee
     prices in 1986 threw the economy into a recession, from which the
     country has yet to fully recover. Continuing weak prices for commodity
     exports, a bloated public-sector wage bill, and a large foreign debt
     will continue to constrain economic development, this despite the 50%
     currency devaluation in January 1994 designed to restore international
     price competitiveness. A large, non-competitive import-substitution
     sector continues to thrive under steep tariff and import quota
     barriers.
