                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important agricultural, mining,
     energy, tourism and manufacturing sectors. The economy grew rapidly in
     the mid-1980s, GDP growth averaging 5.4% in 1983-85. Following a
     foreign exchange crisis caused by a sharp drop in agricultural output
     and tourism, combined with the oil price collapse in 1986, Tunisia
     inaugurated an IMF-sponsored economic rehabilitation scheme.
     Subsequent government structural reforms have helped liberalize and
     open the economy, and GDP growth has been positive since the start of
     the program. A sharp rebound in tourism from the downturn caused by
     the Gulf war and strong agricultural performance boosted real GDP
     growth to more than 8% in 1992; growth fell back to 2.6% in 1993.
     Further privatization and further improvements in government
     administrative efficiency are among the challenges for the future.
