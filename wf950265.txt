Overview:
     The economy has been in decline for more than a decade with falling
     imports and growing foreign debt. Economic difficulties stem from a

     economic policies. In 1991 real GDP fell by 2% and in 1992 by 3% more.
     An annual population growth of 3% has brought a decline in per capita
     GDP of 50% over the past decade. A high inflation rate has also added
     to Zambia's economic woes in recent years.
