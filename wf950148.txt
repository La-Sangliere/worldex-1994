                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least developed countries.
     The economy is predominately agricultural, with about 90% of the
     population living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for 40% of GDP
     and 90% of export revenues. After two years of weak performance,
     economic growth improved significantly in 1988-91 as a result of good
     weather and a broadly based economic adjustment effort by the
     government. Drought cut overall output sharply in 1992. The economy
     depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF,
     the World Bank, and individual donor nations.
