                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. Agriculture,
     including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy,
     accounting for over 30% of GDP and contributing more than 70% of total
     export earnings. Industry is largely confined to the processing of
     agricultural products and textile manufacturing; in 1991 it accounted
     for only 13% of GDP. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year
     development plan that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice)
     by 1990, increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports.
     Subsequently, growth in output has been held back because of
     protracted antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political
     reform.
