                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the economy, accounting for
     roughly 57% of government revenues, 25% of GDP, and almost all export
     earnings; Algeria has the fifth largest reserves of natural gas in the
     world and ranks fourteenth for oil. Algiers' efforts to reform one of
     the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world began after the
     1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the country into a severe
     recession. In 1989, the government launched a comprehensive,
     IMF-supported program to achieve macroeconomic stabilization and to
     introduce market mechanisms into the economy. Despite substantial
     progress toward macroeconomic adjustment, in 1992 the reform drive
     stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political turmoil. In September
     1993, a new government was formed, one of whose priorities was the
     resumption and acceleration of the structural adjustment process.
     Buffeted by the slump in world oil prices and burdened with a heavy
     foreign debt, Algiers in 1993 resumed negotiations with the IMF and is
     on track to conclude a standby arrangement with the Fund in 1994.
