                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     The dissolution of Czechoslovakia into two independent states - the
     Czech Republic and Slovakia - on 1 January 1993 has complicated the
     task of moving toward a more open and decentralized economy. The old
     Czechoslovakia, even though highly industrialized by East European
     standards, suffered from an aging capital plant, lagging technology,
     and a deficiency in energy and many raw materials. In January 1991,
     approximately one year after the end of communist control of Eastern
     Europe, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic launched a sweeping
     program to convert its almost entirely state-owned and controlled
     economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these measures resulted in
     privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic activity and
     the setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a cost
     in inflation, unemployment, and lower output. For Czechoslovakia as a
     whole inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992
     in Slovakia, inflation slowed to an estimated 8.7% and the estimated
     fall in GDP was a more moderate 7%. In 1993 GDP fell roughly 5%, with
     the disruptions from the separation from the Czech lands probably
     accounting for half the decline; exports to the Czech Republic fell
     about 35%. Bratislava adopted an austerity program in June and
     devalued its currency 10% in July. In 1993, inflation rose an
     estimated 23%, unemployment topped 14%, and the budget deficit
     exceeded the IMF target of $485 million by over $200 million. By
     yearend 1993 Bratislava estimated that 29% of GDP was being produced
     in the private sector. The forecast for 1994 is gloomy; Bratislava
     optimistically projects no growth in GDP, 17% unemployment, a $425
     million budget deficit, and 12% inflation. At best, if Slovakia stays
     on track with the IMF, GDP could fall by only 2-3% in 1994 and
     unemployment could be held under 18%, but a currency devaluation will
     likely drive inflation above 15%.
