                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Agriculture employs more than half of the labor force, contributes 50%
     to GDP, and furnishes 90% of exports. The bulk of export earnings
     comes from the sale of coconut oil and copra. The economy depends on
     emigrant remittances and foreign aid to support a level of imports
     much greater than export earnings. Tourism has become the most
     important growth industry, and construction of the first international
     hotel is under way. The economy continued to falter in 1993, as
     remittances and tourist earnings fell off. A fungal plant disease
     severely damaged the taro crop, the primary food and export crop.
