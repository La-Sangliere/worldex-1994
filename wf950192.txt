Type:
     republic
Capital:

Administrative divisions:
     24 departments (departamentos, singular - departamento) and 1
     constitutional province* (provincia constitucional); Amazonas, Ancash,
     Apurimac, Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Callao*, Cusco, Huancavelica,
     Huanuco, Ica, Junin, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Lima, Loreto, Madre de
     Dios, Moquegua, Pasco, Piura, Puno, San Martin, Tacna, Tumbes, Ucayali
note:
     the 1979 Constitution and legislation enacted from 1987 to 1990
     mandate the creation of regions (regiones, singular - region) intended
     to function eventually as autonomous economic and administrative
     entities; so far, 12 regions have been constituted from 23 existing
     departments - Amazonas (from Loreto), Andres Avelino Caceres (from
     Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from Arequipa), Chavin (from
     Ancash), Grau (from Tumbes, Piura), Inca (from Cusco, Madre de Dios,
     Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad), Los Libertadores-Huari
     (from Ica, Ayacucho, Huancavelica), Mariategui (from Moquegua, Tacna,
     Puno), Nor Oriental del Maranon (from Lambayeque, Cajamarca,
     Amazonas), San Martin (from San Martin), Ucayali (from Ucayali);
     formation of another region has been delayed by the reluctance of the
     constitutional province of Callao to merge with the department of
     Lima. Because of inadequate funding from the central government and
     organizational and political difficulties, the regions have yet to
     assume major responsibilities. The 1993 Constitution maintains the
     regionalization process with some modifications that will limit the
     powers of the regional governments. The new constitution also
     reaffirms the roles of departmental and municipal governments.

                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented, with
     major privatizations scheduled for 1994 in the mining and
     telecommunications industries. In the 1980s the economy suffered from
     hyperinflation, declining per capita output, and mounting external
     debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World Bank support in the
     mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An austerity program
     implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in July
     1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
     activity, but the slide halted late that year, and output rose 2.4% in
     1991. After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated
     government price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the
     single-digit level and by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase
     since mid-1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue package from
     multilateral lenders in September 1991, although it faced $14 billion
     in arrears on its external debt. By working with the IMF and World
     Bank on new financial conditions and arrangements, the government
     succeeded in ending its arrears by March 1993. In 1992, GDP fell by
     2.8%, in part because a warmer-than-usual El Nino current resulted in
     a 30% drop in the fish catch. In 1993 the economy rebounded as strong
     foreign investment helped push growth to 6%.
