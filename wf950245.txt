Overview:
     Tuvalu consists of a scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor
     soil. The country has no known mineral resources and few exports.
     Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic activities.
     The islands are too small and too remote for development of a tourist
     industry. Government revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and
     coins and worker remittances. Substantial income is received annually
     from an international trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, NZ,
     and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea.
