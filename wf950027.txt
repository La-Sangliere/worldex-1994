                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its central
     geographic location, highly developed transport network, and
     diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated
     mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, although the
     government is encouraging reinvestment in the southern region of
     Walloon. With few natural resources Belgium must import substantial
     quantities of raw materials and export a large volume of manufactures,
     making its economy unusually dependent on the state of world markets.
     Three fourths of its trade is with other EC countries. The economy
     grew at a strong 4% pace during the period 1988-90, but economic
     growth slowed to a 1% pace in 1991-92 and dropped by 1.5% in 1993.
     Belgium's public debt has risen to 140% of GDP, and the government is
     trying to control its expenditures to bring the figure more into line
     with other industrialized countries.
