                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Latvia is rapidly becoming a dynamic market economy, rivaled only by
     Estonia among the former Soviet states in the speed of its
     transformation. The transition has been painful with GDP falling over
     45% in 1992-93, according to official statistics, and industrial
     production experiencing even steeper declines. Nevertheless, the
     government's tough monetary policies and reform program, which foster
     the development of the private sector and market mechanisms, have kept
     inflation low, created a dynamic private sector - much of which is not
     captured in official statistics - and expanded trade ties with the
     West. Much of agriculture is already privatized and the government
     plans to step up the pace of privatization of state enterprises. The
     economy is now poised for recovery and will benefit from the country's
     strategic location on the Baltic Sea, its well-educated population,
     and its diverse - albeit largely obsolete - industrial structure.
