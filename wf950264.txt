                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Zaire's economy has continued to disintegrate. While meaningful
     economic figures are difficult to come by, Zaire's hyperinflation, the
     largest government deficit ever, and plunging mineral production have
     made the country one of the world's poorest. Most formal transactions
     are conducted in hard currency as indigenous banknotes have lost
     almost all value, and a barter economy now flourishes in all but the
     largest cities. Most individuals and families hang on grimly through
     subsistence farming and petty trade. The government has not been able
     to meet its financial obligations to the International Momentary Fund
     or put in place the financial measures advocated by the IMF. Although
     short-term prospects for improvement are dim, improved political
     stability would boost Zaire's long-term potential to effectively
     exploit its vast wealth of mineral and agricultural resources.
