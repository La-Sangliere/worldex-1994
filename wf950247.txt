                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the most
     important economic component of the former Soviet Union producing more
     than three times the output of the next-ranking republic. Its fertile
     black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural
     output, and its farms provided substantial quantities of meat, milk,
     grain and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its diversified
     heavy industry supplied equipment and raw materials to industrial and
     mining sites in other regions of the former USSR. In 1992 the
     Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal
     framework for privatizing state enterprises while retaining many
     central economic controls and continuing subsidies to state production
     enterprises. In November 1992 the new Prime Minister KUCHMA launched a
     new economic reform program promising more freedom to the agricultural
     sector, faster privatization of small and medium enterprises, and
     stricter control over state subsidies. In 1993, however, severe
     internal political disputes over the scope and pace of economic reform
     and payment arrears on energy imports have led to further declines in
     output, and inflation of 50% or more per month by the last quarter. In
     first quarter 1994, national income and industrial output were less
     than two-thirds the first quarter 1993 figures, according to official
     statistics. At the same time an increasing number of people are
     developing small private businesses and exploiting opportunities in
     non-official markets. Even so, the magnitude of the problems and the
     slow pace in building new market-oriented institutions preclude a
     near-term recovery of output to the 1990 level. A vital economic
     concern in 1994 will continue to be Russia's decisions on the prices
     and quantities of oil and gas to be shipped to the Ukraine.
National product:
     GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $205.4 billion (1993 estimate from
     the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and
     published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993; and as
     extrapolated to 1993 using official Ukrainian statistics, which are
     very uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)

     atomic weapons from the US in 1994
Currency:
     Ukraine withdrew the Russian ruble from circulation on 12 November
     1992 and declared the karbovanets (plural karbovantsi) sole legal

     interim move toward introducing a new currency - the hryvnya -
     possibly in mid-1994

     through Kiev's EWSD digital exchange; electronic mail services have
     been established in Kiev, Odessa, and Lugansk by Sprint; satellite
     earth stations employ INTELSAT, INMARSAT, and Intersputnik

     conversion of the military budget into US dollars using the current
     exchange rate could produce misleading results
