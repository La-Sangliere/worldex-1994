                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New Zealand. Government
     expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by
     grants from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public
     employees. The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence
     gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry
     consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime
     oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign
     collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent
     years has suffered a serious loss of population because of migration
     of Niueans to New Zealand.
