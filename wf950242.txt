                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     In early 1994, after an impressive economic performance through most
     of the 1980s, Turkey faces its most damaging economic crisis in the
     last 15 years. Sparked by the downgrading in mid-January of Turkey's
     international credit rating by two US credit rating agencies, the
     crisis stems from two years of loose fiscal and monetary policies that
     have exacerbated inflation and allowed the public debt, money supply,
     and current account deficit to explode. Under Prime Minister CILLER,
     Ankara has followed seriously flawed policies that have destroyed
     public confidence in the government's ability to manage the economy.
     Inflation is now running at an annual rate of 107% and the public
     sector deficit is equivalent to 16% of GDP. Turkish firms have been
     hurt by high interest rates and a dramatic drop in consumer demand.
     Three Turkish banks have folded and the stock market has fallen 48%
     since the beginning of the year. Economic growth may drop to between
     0% and 2% in 1994, compared to 7.3% in 1993. Moreover, the government
     is facing a severe cash crunch. In March 1994, the treasury came close
     to defaulting on a loan, and official foreign currency reserves are
     equal to less than two months' worth of imports. The unprecedented
     effort by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to raise the economic
     costs of its insurgency against the Turkish state is adding to
     Turkey's economic problems. Attacks against the tourism industry have
     cut tourist revenues, which account for about 3% of GDP, while
     economic activity in southeastern Turkey, where most of the violence
     occurs, has dropped considerably. To cope with the economic crisis and
     instill domestic and international investor confidence in the fragile
     coalition government, CILLER has asked the IMF to endorse a
     stabilization package she introduced in early April 1994. Negotiations
     are underway for a standby agreement, which would give Turkey access
     to $450 million this year and enable her cash-starved government to
     return to the foreign capital markets.
