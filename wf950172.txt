                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     This highly developed and affluent economy is based on private
     enterprise. The government makes its presence felt, however, through
     many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare programs affecting
     most aspects of economic activity. The trade and financial services
     sector contributes over 50% of GDP. Industrial activity provides about
     25% of GDP and is led by the food-processing, oil-refining, and
     metalworking industries. The highly mechanized agricultural sector
     employs only 5% of the labor force, but provides large surpluses for
     export and the domestic food-processing industry. Rising unemployment
     and a sizable budget deficit are currently the most serious economic
     problems. Many of the economic issues of the 1990s will reflect the
     course of European economic integration.
