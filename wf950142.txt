                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from
     the oil sector, which contributes practically all export earnings and
     about one-third of GDP. In 1990 per capita GDP was the highest in
     Africa at $5,410, but GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate
     sharply in response to changes in the world oil market. Import
     restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to
     shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. Windfall revenues from the
     hike in world oil prices in late 1990 improved the foreign payments
     position and resulted in a current account surplus through 1992. The
     nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for about
     20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products
     to include petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Although
     agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs about 20% of the
     labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm
     output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food requirements. The UN
     sanctions imposed in April 1992 have not yet had a major impact on the
     economy because Libya's oil revenues generate sufficient foreign
     exchange that, along with Libya's large currency reserves, sustain
     food and consumer goods imports as well as equipment for the oil
     industry and ongoing development projects.
