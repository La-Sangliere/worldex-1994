     States, Commonwealth of Independent States - European States, Middle
     East, Standard Time Zones of the World
Area:
total area:
     86,600 sq km
land area:
     86,100 sq km
comparative area:
     slightly larger than Maine
note:
     includes the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic and the Nagorno-Karabakh

     0 km (landlocked)
note:
     Azerbaijan borders the Caspian Sea (800 km, est.)
Maritime claims:
     NA
note:
     Azerbaijani claims in Caspian Sea unknown; 10-nm fishing zone provided
     for in 1940 treaty regarding trade and navigation between Soviet Union
     and Iran
International disputes:
     violent and longstanding dispute with ethnic Armenians of
     Nagorno-Karabakh over its status, lesser dispute concerns Nakhichevan;
     some Azerbaijanis desire absorption of and/or unification with the
     ethnic Azeri portion of Iran
Climate:
     dry, semiarid steppe
Terrain:
     large, flat Kur-Araz Lowland (much of it below sea level) with Great
     Caucasus Mountains to the north, Qarabag (Karabakh) Upland in west;
     Baku lies on Abseron (Apsheron) Peninsula that juts into Caspian Sea

Environment:
current issues:
     local scientists consider the Abseron (Apsheron) Peninsula (including
     Baku and Sumqayit) and the Caspian Sea to be the ecologically most
     devastated area in the world because of severe air, water, and soil
     pollution; soil pollution results from the use of DDT as a pesticide
     and also from toxic defoliants used in the production of cotton
natural hazards:
     subject to drought; some coastal areas threatened by rising levels of
     the Caspian Sea

                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or
     Georgia, the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central
     Asian states in its majority Muslim population, high structural
     unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's most prominent
     products are oil, cotton, and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and
     gas field has been in decline for several years. With foreign
     assistance, the oil industry might generate the funds needed to spur
     industrial development. However, civil unrest, marked by armed
     conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim Azeris and
     Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan
     accounted for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former
     Soviet Union. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the
     ex-Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a
     market economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its
     prospects somewhat. Old economic ties and structures have yet to be
     replaced. A particularly galling constraint on economic revival is the
     Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said to consume 25% of Azerbaijan's
     economic resources.
National product:
