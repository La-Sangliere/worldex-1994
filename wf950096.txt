                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Greenland's economic situation at present is difficult. Unemployment
     is increasing, and prospects for economic growth in the immediate
     future are dim. Following the closing of the Black Angel lead and zinc
     mine in 1989, Greenland became almost completely dependent on fishing
     and fish processing, the sector accounting for 95% of exports.
     Prospects for fisheries are not bright, as the important shrimp
     catches will at best stabilize and cod catches have dropped.
     Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon activities is not around the
     corner, thus leaving only tourism with some potential for the near
     future. The public sector in Greenland, i.e., the central government
     and its commercial entities and the municipalities, plays a dominant
     role in Greenland accounting for about two-thirds of total employment.
     About half the government's revenues come from grants from the Danish
     Government.
