     12 nm
International disputes:
     Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations in 1990 but are still
     trying to work out written agreements settling outstanding disputes
     from their eight-year war concerning border demarcation,
     prisoners-of-war, and freedom of navigation and sovereignty over the
     Shatt al Arab waterway; in April 1991 official Iraqi acceptance of UN
     Security Council Resolution 687, which demands that Iraq accept the
     inviolability of the boundary set forth in its 1963 agreement with
     Kuwait, ending earlier claims to Bubiyan and Warbah islands or to all
     of Kuwait; the 20 May 1993 final report of the UN Iraq/Kuwait Boundary
     Demarcation Commission was welcomed by the Security Council in
     Resolution 833 of 27 May 1993, which also reaffirmed that the
     decisions of the commission on the boundary were final, bringing to a
     completion the official demarcation of the Iraq-Kuwait boundary; Iraqi
     officials still refuse to unconditionally recognize Kuwaiti
     sovereignty or the inviolability of the UN demarcated border; periodic
     disputes with upstream riparian Syria over Euphrates water rights;
     potential dispute over water development plans by Turkey for the
     Tigris and Euphrates Rivers

current issues:
     government water control projects drain inhabited marsh areas, drying
     up or diverting the streams and rivers that support a sizable
     population of Shi'a Muslims who have inhabited these areas for
     thousands of years; the destruction of the natural habitat also poses
     serious threats to the wildlife populations; damage to water treatment
     and sewage facilities during Gulf war; inadequate supplies of potable
     water; development of Tigris-Euphrates Rivers system contingent upon
     agreements with upstream riparians (Syria, Turkey); air and water
     pollution; soil degradation (salinization) and erosion;
     desertification

                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central planning and
     management of industrial production and foreign trade while leaving
     some small-scale industry and services and most agriculture to private
     enterprise. The economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which
     has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In
     the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the
     eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran,
     led the government to implement austerity measures and to borrow
     heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments. After the end of
     hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with the
     construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities.
     Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages,
     salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land reform and
     collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although accorded
     high priority by the government, also was under financial constraints.
     Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international
     economic embargoes, and military action by an international coalition
     beginning in January 1991 drastically changed the economic picture.
     Industrial and transportation facilities suffered severe damage and
     have been only partially restored. Oil exports remain at less than 10%
     of the previous level. Shortages of spare parts continue. Living
     standards deteriorated even further in 1993 and early 1994; consumer
     prices at least tripled in 1993. The UN-sponsored economic embargo has
     reduced exports and imports and has contributed to the sharp rise in
     prices. The government's policies of supporting large military and
     internal security forces and of allocating resources to key supporters
     of the regime have exacerbated shortages. In brief, per capita output
     in 1993-94 is far below the 1989-90 level, but no precise estimate is
     available.
