                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     One of the world's most developed economies, France has substantial
     agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial
     sector. Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern
     technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading
     agricultural producer in Western Europe. Largely self-sufficient in
     agricultural products, France is a major exporter of wheat and dairy
     products. The industrial sector generates about one-quarter of GDP,
     and the growing services sector has become crucial to the economy.
     Although French GDP contracted by 0.7% in 1993, the economy showed
     signs of life by yearend. GDP growth, however, will remain sluggish in
     1994 - perhaps reaching only 1.0%. Rapidly increasing unemployment
     will still pose a major problem for the government. Paris remains
     committed to maintaining the franc-deutsche mark parity, which has
     kept French interest rates high despite France's low inflation.
     Although the pace of economic integration within the European
     Community has slowed down, integration presumably will remain a major
     force shaping the fortunes of the various economic sectors.
