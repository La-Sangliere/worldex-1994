Overview:
     The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism the most

     1986-91, real GDP expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%.

     affects growth in other sectors - particularly in construction,
     communications, and public utilities. In 1992, reduced government
     capital spending and private sector investment, dampened by recession
     in the major world economies, slowed economic growth.
