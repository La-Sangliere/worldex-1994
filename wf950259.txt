     The war between Israel and Egypt, Syria, and Jordan in June 1967 ended
     with Israel in control of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza
     Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. Israel withdrew
     from the Sinai Peninsula pursuant to a 1979 peace treaty with Egypt.
     The Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
     Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13 September 1993,
     provides for a transitional period not exceeding five years of
     Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West
     Bank. Under the DOP, final status negotiations are to begin no later
     than the beginning of the third year of the transitional period.

Note:
     Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim

     certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, and
     subsequently to an elected Palestinian Council, as part of interim
     self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A
     transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho
     has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement
     on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area. The DOP provides that Israel
     will retain responsibility during the transitional period for external
     security and for internal security and public order of settlements and
     Israelis. Final status is to be determined through direct negotiations
     within five years.

Overview:
     Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli
     military administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising
     (intifadah). Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable
     investment have been discouraged by a lack of local capital and
     restrictive Israeli policies. Capital investment consists largely of
     residential housing, not productive assets that would enable local
     Palestinian firms to compete with Israeli industry. A major share of
     GNP has traditionally been derived from remittances of workers
     employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states. Such transfers from the
     Gulf dropped after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake of
     the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West
     Bank, increasing unemployment, and export revenues have dropped
     because of the decline of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states.
     Israeli measures to curtail the intifadah also have added to
     unemployment and lowered living standards. The area's economic
     situation has worsened since Israel's partial closure of the
     territories in 1993.
