                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas.
     Growth has been uneven because of natural disasters, fluctuations in
     global oil prices, and government policies designed to curb inflation.
     Banana exports, second only to oil, have suffered as a result of
     import quotas of the European Union and banana blight. The new
     President Sixto DURAN-BALLEN, has a much more favorable attitude
     toward foreign investment than did his predecessor. Ecuador has
     implemented trade agreements with Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and
     Venezuela and has applied for GATT membership. At the end of 1991,
     Ecuador received a standby IMF loan of $105 million, which will permit
     the country to proceed with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt. In
     September 1992, the government launched a new, macroeconomic program
     that gives more play to market forces. In 1993, the DURAN-BALLEN
     administration adopted a rigorous austerity program that resulted in
     economic stabilization, with inflation cut in half and international
     reserves boosted to a record $1.3 billion. Growth in 1993 was perhaps
     only 2% due to falling export prices, notably oil, and slow progress
     on privatization.
