                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.
     Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy, accounts for
     more than 25% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces
     two-thirds of exports. Productivity remains low. Industry, still in
     its early stages, employs nearly 9% of the labor force, accounts for
     15% of GDP, and generates 20% of exports. The service sectors,
     including public administration, account for 50% of GDP and employ 20%
     of the labor force. Basic problems facing the economy include rapid
     population growth, high unemployment, a lack of basic services, a
     large and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of the export
     sector mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to sharp price
     fluctuations. A far-reaching reform program initiated by former
     President CALLEJAS in 1990 is beginning to take hold. In 1993 the
     large fiscal deficit emerged as a key economic problem, the result of
     improvident state spending.
