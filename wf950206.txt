                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing
     and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of
     Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however, because the
     number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the
     years. In March 1989, an agreement between France and Canada set fish
     quotas for Saint Pierre's trawlers fishing in Canadian and
     Canadian-claimed waters for three years. The agreement settles a
     longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish exports to a
     halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France. Imports come
     primarily from Canada and France.
