                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, although the poorest
     republic in the former Yugoslav federation, can meet basic food and
     energy needs through its own agricultural and coal resources. Its
     economic decline will continue unless ties are reforged or enlarged
     with its neighbors Serbia and Montenegro, Albania, Greece, and
     Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil
     and gas and its modern machinery and parts. Continued political
     turmoil, both internally and in the region as a whole, prevents any
     swift readjustments of trade patterns and economic programs. The
     country's industrial output and GDP are expected to decline further in
     1994. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's geographical
     isolation, technological backwardness, and potential political
     instability place it far down the list of countries of interest to
     Western investors. Resolution of the dispute with Greece and an
     internal commitment to economic reform would help to encourage foreign
     investment over the long run. In the immediate future, the worst
     scenario for the economy would be the spread of fighting across its
     borders.
