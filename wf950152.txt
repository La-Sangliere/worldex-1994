                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Significant resources are limestone, a favorable geographic location,
     and a productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20% of its
     food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic
     energy sources. Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on
     foreign trade and services. Manufacturing and tourism are the largest
     contributors to the economy. Manufacturing accounts for about 27% of
     GDP, with the electronics and textile industries major contributors
     and the state-owned Malta drydocks which employs about 4,300 people.
     In 1992, about 1,000,000 tourists visited the island. Per capita GDP
     at $6,600 places Malta in the middle-income range of the world's
     nations.
