                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The Bulgarian economy continued its painful adjustment in 1993 from
     the misdirected development undertaken during four decades of
     Communist rule. Many aspects of a market economy have been put in
     place and have begun to function, but much of the economy, especially
     the industrial sector, has yet to re-establish market links lost with
     the collapse of other centrally planned Eastern European economies.
     The prices of many imported industrial inputs, especially energy
     products, have risen markedly, and falling real wages have not
     sufficed to restore competitiveness. The trade deficit, exacerbated by
     UN trade sanctions against neighboring Serbia, grew in late 1993,
     accelerating the depreciation of the lev. These difficulties in
     adjusting to the challenges of a more open system, together with a
     severe drought, caused nonagricultural output to fall by perhaps 8% in
     1993. The government plans more extensive privatization in 1994 to
     improve the management of state enterprises and to encourage foreign
     investment in ailing state firms. Bulgaria resumed payments on its $10
     billion in commercial debt in 1993 following the negotiation of a 50%
     write-off. An IMF program and second agreement with official creditors
     on Bulgaria's smaller amount of official debt are required to close
     the debt deal.
