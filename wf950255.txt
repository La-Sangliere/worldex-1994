                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Vietnam has made significant progress in recent years moving away from
     the planned economic model toward a more effective market-based
     economic system. Most prices are now fully decontrolled, and the
     Vietnamese currency has been effectively devalued and floated at world
     market rates. In addition, the scope for private sector activity has
     been expanded, primarily through decollectivization of the
     agricultural sector and introduction of laws giving legal recognition
     to private business. Nearly three-quarters of export earnings are
     generated by only two commodities, rice and crude oil. Led by industry
     and construction, the economy did well in 1993 with output rising
     perhaps 7%. However, the industrial sector remains burdened by
     uncompetitive state-owned enterprises the government is unwilling or
     unable to privatize. Unemployment looms as a serious problem with
     roughly 25% of the workforce without jobs and with population growth
     swelling the ranks of the unemployed yearly.
