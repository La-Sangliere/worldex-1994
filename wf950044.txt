                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The Cambodian economy - virtually destroyed by decades of war - is
     slowly recovering. Government leaders are moving toward restoring
     fiscal and monetary discipline and have established good working
     relations with international financial institutions. Despite such
     positive developments, the reconstruction effort faces many tough
     challenges. Rural Cambodia, where 90% of almost ten million Khmer
     live, remains mired in poverty. The almost total lack of basic
     infrastructure in the countryside will hinder development and will
     contribute to a growing imbalance in growth between urban and rural
     areas over the near term. Moreover, the new government's lack of
     experience in administering economic and technical assistance
     programs, and rampant corruption among officials, will slow the growth
     of critical public sector investment. Inflation for 1993 as a whole
     was 60%, less than a quarter of the 1992 rate, and was declining
     during the year. The government hoped the rate would fall to 10% in
     early 1994.
