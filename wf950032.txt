Overview:
     With its long history of semifeudal social controls, dependence on
     volatile prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of hyperinflation,
     Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least developed Latin
     American countries. However, Bolivia has experienced generally
     improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro administration
     (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies which reduced inflation
     from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ Estenssoro was followed
     as President by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93) who continued the
     free-market policies of his predecessor, despite opposition from his
     own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor movement. By
     maintaining fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce inflation to
     9.3% in 1993, while GDP grew by an annual average of 3.25% during his
     tenure. Inaugurated in August 1993, President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA has
     vowed to advance government market-oriented economic reforms he helped
     launch as PAZ Estenssoro's Planning Minister. A major privatization
     bill was passed by the Bolivian legislature in late March 1994.
