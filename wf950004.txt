Overview:
     Economic activity is strongly linked to the US, with which American
     Samoa conducts 80%-90% of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna
     processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned
     tuna the primary export. The tuna canneries and the government are by
     far the two largest employers. Other economic activities include a
     slowly developing tourist industry. Transfers from the US Government
     add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being.
