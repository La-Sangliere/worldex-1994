                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Agriculture, forestry, and fishing account for about half of GDP and
     nearly all exports. Subsistence farming predominates. Although
     pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for
     hard currency earnings, the deterioration of the rural economy under
     successive brutal regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led
     growth. A number of AID programs sponsored by the World Bank and the
     international donor community have failed to revitalize export
     agriculture. There is little industry; businesses for the most part
     are owned by government officials and their family members. Commerce
     accounts for about 8% of GDP and the construction, public works, and
     service sectors for about 38%. Undeveloped natural resources include
     titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil
     exploration, taking place under concessions offered to US, French, and
     Spanish firms, has been moderately successful. Increased production
     from recently discovered natural gas fields will provide a greater
     share of exports by 1995.
