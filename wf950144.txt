Overview:
     Since independence in September 1991, Lithuania has made steady
     progress in developing a market economy. Over 40% of state property
     has been privatized and trade is diversifying with a gradual shift
     away from the former Soviet Union to Western markets. Nevertheless,
     the process has been painful with industrial output in 1993 less than
     half the 1991 level. Inflation, while lower than in most ex-Soviet
     states, has exceeded rates in the other Baltic states. Full monetary
     stability and economic recovery are likely to be impeded by periodic
     government backtracking on key elements of its reform and
     stabilization program as it seeks to ease the economic pain of
     restructuring. Recovery will build on Lithuanian's strategic location
     with its ice-free port at Klaipeda and its rail and highway hub in
     Vilnius connecting it with Eastern Europe, Belarus, Russia, and
     Ukraine, and on its agriculture potential, highly skilled labor force,
     and diversified industrial sector. Lacking important natural
     resources, it will remain dependent on imports of fuels and raw
     materials.
