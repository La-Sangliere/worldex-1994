                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture, which
     accounts for about 33% of GDP and provides employment for 78% of the
     labor force. Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee, and
     cotton, which together generate about 30% of total export earnings.
     Togo is self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal.
     In the industrial sector phosphate mining is by far the most important
     activity, although it has suffered from the collapse of World
     phosphate prices and increased foreign competition. Togo serves as a
     regional commercial and trade center. The government's decade-long IMF
     and World Bank supported effort to implement economic reform measures
     to encourage foreign investment and bring revenues in line with
     expenditures has stalled. Political unrest, including private and
     public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, has jeopardized the
     reform program and has disrupted vital economic activity.
