Overview:
     Turkmenistan is a largely desert country with nomadic cattle raising,
     intensive agriculture in irrigated oases, and huge gas and oil
     resources. Half of its irrigated land is planted in cotton; it is the
     world's tenth largest producer. It also is the world's fourth largest
     producer of natural gas and has the fifth largest reserves.
     Furthermore, Turkmenistan has substantial oil resources; its two oil
     refineries make it an exporter of refined products. Profiting from the
     move toward market prices for its oil and gas resources, Turkmenistan
     has suffered the least economic decline of the 15 states of the former
     USSR. With an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in power and a
     tribally based social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious
     approach to questions of economic reform, using the profits from its
     gas and cotton exports to sustain a generally inefficient economy.
     Economic restructuring and privatization have just begun, and price
     liberalization and price increases have been accompanied by generous
     wage hikes and subsidies. At the same time, Turkmenistan faces serious
     constraints on its gas and oil earnings because of the inability of
     its traditional regional customers to pay for the current level of
     purchases and the lack of pipeline access to hard currency markets.
     Faced with financial shortfalls, rampant inflation, and the desire to
     ensure a stable currency, the regime has become more receptive to
     market reforms yet still seeks to offer widespread social benefits to
     its population and to retain state domination over the economy.
