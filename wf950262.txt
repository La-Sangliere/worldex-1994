Overview:
     Real global output - gross world product (GWP) - rose roughly 2% in
     1993, with results varying widely among regions and countries. Average
     growth of 1% in the GDP of industrialized countries (57% of GWP in
     1993) and average growth of 6% in the GDP of less developed countries
     (37% of GWP) were partly offset by a further 10% drop in the GDP of
     the former USSR/Eastern Europe area (now only 6% of GWP). Within the
     industrialized world the US posted a 3% growth rate whereas both Japan
     and the 12-member European Union (formerly the European Community) had
     zero growth. With the notable exception of Japan at 2.5%, unemployment
     was typically 6-11% in the industrial world. The US accounted for 22%
     of GWP in 1993; Western Europe accounted for 22.5%; and Japan
     accounted for 9%. These are the three "economic superpowers" which are
     presumably destined to compete for mastery in international markets on
     into the 21st century. As for the less developed countries, China,
     India, and the Four Dragons--South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
     Singapore--once again posted good records; however, many other
     countries, especially in Africa, continued to suffer from drought,
     rapid population growth, inflation, and civil strife. Central Europe,
     especially Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, made considerable
     progress in moving toward "market-friendly" economies, whereas the 15
     ex-Soviet countries typically experienced further declines in output
     of 10-15%. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock
     economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
     international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.
     Internally, the central government in a number of cases is losing
     control over resources as separatist regional movements - typically
     based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of
     the former Soviet Union, in former Yugoslavia, and in India. In
     Western Europe, governments face the difficult political problem of
     channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase
     investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The addition
     of nearly 100 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe
     is exacerbating the problems of pollution, desertification,
     underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of their own internal
     problems, the industrialized countries have inadequate resources to
     deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world, which, at least
     from the economic point of view, are becoming further marginalized.
     (For the specific economic problems of each country, see the
     individual country entries in this volume.)
National product:
     GWP (gross world product) - purchasing power equivalent - $29 trillion
     (1993 est.)
National product real growth rate:
     2% (1993 est.)
National product per capita:
     $5,200 (1993 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
developed countries:
     5% (1993 est.)
developing countries:
     50% (1993 est.)
note:
     these figures vary widely in individual cases
 
 
Unemployment rate:
     developed countries typically 6%-11%; developing countries, extensive
     unemployment and underemployment (1993)
Exports:
     $3.64 trillion (f.o.b., 1992 est.)
commodities:
     the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and services
partners:
     in value, about 75% of exports from the developed countries
Imports:
     $3.82 trillion (c.i.f., 1992 est.)
commodities:
     the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and services
partners:
     in value, about 75% of imports by the developed countries
External debt:
     $1 trillion for less developed countries (1993 est.)
Industrial production:
     growth rate -1% (1992 est.)
Electricity:
capacity:
     2,864,000,000 kW
production:
     11.45 trillion kWh
consumption per capita:
     2,150 kWh (1990)
Industries:
     industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology,
     especially in computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines
     and medical equipment; most of these advances take place in OECD
     nations; only a small portion of non-OECD countries have succeeded in
     rapidly adjusting to these technological forces, and the technological
     gap between the industrial nations and the less-developed countries
     continues to widen; the rapid development of new industrial (and
     agricultural) technology is complicating already grim environmental
     problems
Agriculture:
     the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the
     last 20 years; the annual production of cereals, for instance, has
     risen by 50%, from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion
     metric tons; production increases have resulted mainly from increased
     yields rather than increases in planted areas; while global production
     is sufficient for aggregate demand, about one-fifth of the world's
     population remains malnourished, primarily because local production
     cannot adequately provide for large and rapidly growing populations,
     which are too poor to pay for food imports; conditions are especially
     bad in Africa where drought in recent years has intensified the
     consequences of overpopulation
Economic aid:
     $NA

     251,153 km of broad gauge track; includes about 190,000 to 195,000 km
     of electrified routes of which 147,760 km are in Europe, 24,509 km in
     the Far East, 11,050 km in Africa, 4,223 km in South America, and only
     4,160 km in North America; fastest speed in daily service is 300 km/hr
