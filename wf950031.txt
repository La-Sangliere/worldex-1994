                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on
     agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of
     the population and account for about 50% of GDP. Rugged mountains
     dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other
     infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned
     with that of India through strong trade and monetary links. The
     industrial sector is small and technologically backward, with most
     production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects,
     such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's
     hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are its most
     important natural resources; however, the government limits the number
     of tourists to 4,000 per year to minimize foreign influence. Much of
     the impetus for growth has come from large public-sector companies.
     Nevertheless, in recent years, Bhutan has shifted toward decentralized
     development planning and greater private initiative. The government
     privatized several large public-sector firms, is revamping its trade
     regime and liberalizing administerial procedures over industrial
     licensing. The government's industrial contribution to GDP decreased
     from 13% in 1988 to about 10% in 1992.
