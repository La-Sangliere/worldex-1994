Overview:
     Belarus ranks among the most developed of the former Soviet states,
     with a relatively modern - by Soviet standards - and diverse machine
     building sector and a robust agriculture sector. It also serves as a
     transport link for Russian oil exports to the Baltic states and
     Eastern and Western Europe. The breakup of the Soviet Union and its
     command economy has resulted in a sharp economic contraction as
     traditional trade ties have collapsed. At the same time, the
     Belarusian Government has lagged behind most other former Soviet
     states in economic reform; privatization has barely begun; the
     agriculture sector remains highly subsidized; the state retains
     control over many prices; and the system of state orders and
     distribution persists. Meanwhile, the national bank continues to pour
     credits into inefficient enterprises, fueling inflation and weakening
     incentives to improve performance. The government is pinning its hopes
     on reintegration with the Russian economy, but such a path would only
     partially restore traditional trade ties. Until economic reform is
     embraced, Belarus will continue in its economic morass.
National product:

     the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and
