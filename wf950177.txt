                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Niger's economy is centered on subsistence agriculture, animal
     husbandry, and re-export trade, and increasingly less on uranium, its
     major export throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Uranium revenues dropped
     by almost 50% between 1983 and 1990. Terms of trade with Nigeria,
     Niger's largest regional trade partner, have improved dramatically
     since the 50% devaluation of the African franc in January 1994; this
     devaluation boosted exports of livestock, peas, onions, and the
     products of Niger's small cotton industry. The government relies on
     bilateral and multilateral aid for operating expenses and public
     investment, and is strongly induced to adhere to structural adjustment
     programs designed by the IMF and the World Bank.
