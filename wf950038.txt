                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean area, is
     highly dependent on the tourist industry, which generates about 21% of
     the national income. In 1985 the government offered offshore
     registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands, and,
     in consequence, incorporation fees generated about $2 million in 1987.
     The economy slowed in 1991 because of the poor performances of the
     tourist sector and tight commercial bank credit. Livestock raising is
     the most significant agricultural activity. The islands' crops,
     limited by poor soils, are unable to meet food requirements.
