Overview:
     Petroleum production and processing account for about 80% of export
     receipts, 60% of government revenues, and 30% of GDP. Economic

     Bahrain with its highly developed communication and transport
     facilities is home to numerous multinational firms with business in
     the Gulf. A large share of exports consists of petroleum products made
     from imported crude. Prospects for 1994 are good, with private
     enterprise the main driving force, e.g., in banking and construction.
