                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     The economy is based on service activities connected with the
     country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in
     northeast Africa. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port
     for the region and an international transshipment and refueling
     center. It has few natural resources and little industry. The nation
     is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance (an important
     supplement to GDP) to help support its balance of payments and to
     finance development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30%
     continues to be a major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an
     estimated 35% over the last five years because of recession, civil
     war, and a high population growth rate (including immigrants and
     refugees).
