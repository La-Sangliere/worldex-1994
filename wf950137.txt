                                  Economy
 
Overview:
     Laos has had a Communist centrally planned economy with government
     ownership and control of major productive enterprises. Since 1986,
     however, the government has been decentralizing control and
     encouraging private enterprise. Laos is a landlocked country with a
     primitive infrastructure; it has no railroads, a rudimentary road
     system, limited external and internal telecommunications, and
     electricity available in only a limited area. Subsistence agriculture
     is the main occupation, accounting for over 60% of GDP and providing
     about 85-90% of total employment. The predominant crop is rice. For
     the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend for its
     survival on foreign aid from the IMF and other international sources;
     aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has been cut sharply.
