                                  Economy
 
 
Overview:
     Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved around Black Sea tourism;
     cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and grapes; mining of manganese and
     copper; and a small industrial sector producing wine, metals,
     machinery, chemicals, and textiles. The country imports the bulk of
     its energy needs, including natural gas and coal. Its only sizable
     domestic energy resource is hydropower. Since 1990, widespread
     conflicts, e.g., in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Mengrelia, severely
     aggravated the economic crisis resulting from the disintegration of
     the Soviet command economy in December 1991. Throughout 1993, much of
     industry was functioning at only 20% of capacity; heavy disruptions in
     agricultural cultivation were reported; and tourism was shut down. The
     country is precariously dependent on US and EU humanitarian grain
     shipments, as most other foods are priced beyond reach of the average
     citizen. Georgia is also suffering from an acute energy crisis, as it
     is having problems paying for even minimal imports. Georgia is pinning
     its hopes for recovery on reestablishing trade ties with Russia and on
     developing international transportation through the key Black Sea
     ports of P'ot'i and Bat'umi.
